An auction of a quaint, unrenovated Surry Hills home on Saturday reaped surprising bids, with the owner of the property managing to bag a whooping $1.5 million for the home, which didn't even have a bathroom and had holes in the ceiling.

Claire Dean, 43, noticed an insect bite on her hip while gardening in September last year, but thought nothing of it. A few days later she began suffering mysterious flu-like symptoms, and soon found herself in crippling pain. A few days later she woke up with numb cheeks and noticed her face was paralysed - to the point where she looked unrecognisable in the mirror.

text_response:   Tori Spelling was taken to an emergency room in LA on Friday by her husband, Dean McDermott, adding to what has been a sickness-plagued 12 months for the reality star. The 41-year-old mother-of-four appeared pale and tired as she stepped out of the passenger side of her husband's black Ford Flex station wagon at Encino Hospital Medical Center. Wrapped in a cardigan and beanie, she then took herself into the emergency room. Spelling was seeking treatment for a migraine, which she tweeted about the next day.

Sean Dyche's Burnley earned a shock win against Manchester City to boost their survival hopes and all but end the Manuel Pellegrini's side's hopes of catching Chelsea at the top of the table.
