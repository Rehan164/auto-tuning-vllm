The man, who was killed on Los Angeles' impoverished Skid Row when he allegedly tried to grab the holstered pistol of an officer while police arrested him on Sunday, was from Cameroon, authorities have confirmed. However, attempts to deport him had failed - because the Cameroonian government refused to respond to repeated requests for travel documents. It has already been revealed the man - whose violent death sparked outrage across America - served 15 years behind bars using the name Charley Saturmin Robin

Hummels, who has been dedicated to Borussia Dortmund, is now ready to quit after a dreadful season. Dortmund will hold out for around £36million for their stylish defender but that will not stop Louis van Gaal pushing through a deal as part of another lavish spending spree this summer. Sir Alex Ferguson tried to sign Hummels by making a personal trip to Dortmund back in 2012. But Ferguson was only able to land Shinji Kagawa, who has since returned to the German giants.

Obama also said the investigation - launched in the wake of Michael Brown's death - has revealed an 'oppressive and abusive' police situation. Obama's comments at South Carolina's Benedict College come the day before he leads this weekend's 50th anniversary of 'Bloody Sunday', when police beat scores of people marching from Selma, Alabama, to Montgomery, the state capital, to protest against their lack of voting rights.

The National Weather Service says at least an inch of pea-sized icy pellets coated the sand at Huntington Beach after a fast-moving storm roared ashore Monday morning. And with the air temperature around 40 degrees, the frozen droplets didn’t melt immediately. Thick-skinned beach-goers were spotted building snowmen on the coastline while some surfers even braved the cold. Brianna Burkhart, who works at Duke's restaurant on the city pier, said the sky suddenly turned dark

Farkhunda, a 27-year-old religious scholar, was brutally murdered in Kabul, Afghanistan, after being falsely accused of burning the Koran. The mob that killed her was incited by a local mullah who was known for selling charms to women outside a shrine. Farkhunda was beaten, pushed from a roof, run over by a car, and set on fire before her body was thrown in the Kabul River. The police did not intervene, and 13 officers were suspended for failing to stop the murder. Farkhunda's family has denied reports that she was mentally ill, and her brother said she

His story ends with his dramatic suicide (Matthew 27.3-10), and Luke tells us that his stomach burst open and his intestines gushed out
