Please output the summary only, without any other text.\n\nArticle:\nIt looks like any other anonymous office building. But this nondescript garage in Sunnyvale, California, is where Apple is believed to be building its self driving 'Titan' cars. One blog claims the address is the HQ for the project which could one day take on Tesla. Scroll down for video. This office complex is believed to be home to Apple's secret car project. The building is advertised as home to a mysterious company named SixtyEight Research. Claims that Apple is building a car may seem like a leap, but it isn't the first time such projects have been discussed by the Californian firm. In an interview last year, Apple board member Mickey Drexler said that before his death in 2011 Steve Jobs had considered building a car. He told Paul Goldberger: 'Steve Jobs was gonna design an iCar. 'I think cars have an extraordinary opportunity for cool design.' 'Two people with knowledge of the project say Apple has been working on it and receiving shipments related to its development at a building just minutes from 1 Infinite Loop, in the town of Sunnyvale,' wrote AppleInsider. 'We can confirm that Apple does indeed have a large presence at the location, and that numerous automotive-related renovations, including an 'auto work area' and a'repair garage,' have been constructed on the premises.' The building is advertised as home to a mysterious company named SixtyEight Research. Aside from a sparse website registered through GoDaddy less than a year ago that reveals virtually no information about the company, SixtyEight has no discernible online presence. 'We are experts in market research; helping companies find the relevant market data and industry analysis required to make informed decisions,' its site says. The building is apparently known as SG5 within Apple, and issues visitor passes identical to Apple's - minus the logo. Apple could have an electric car ready to go on sale by 2020, putting it in direct competition with rivals Tesla Motors and General Motors, according to an industry expert. Evidence is mounting that the tech giant is gearing up to revolutionise the automobile market, just as it did with smartphones and tablets. Images taken over the past few weeks have shown a prototype car that suggests Apple is testing the water - ahead of a release in as little as five years. When AppleInsider visited SixtyEight's headquarters at building '175' earlier this week, its windows were a 'frosted' opaque, and security cameras were visible outside. Bloomberg has claimed that Apple could have a car ready by 2020, based on images of a test car. After the first mysterious camera-mounted car was spotted in California last week, further sightings of Apple's minivans have been posted online, with equipment on top (shown here) According to Tim Higgins from Bloomberg, automakers 'typically spend five to seven years developing a car'. And a 2020 timeframe would underscore Apple's 'aggressive goals and could set the stage for a battle for customers with Tesla Motors Inc and General Motors Co.' Both of those are planning to release a sub-£26,000 ($40,000) electric car in 2017 that can travel more than 200 miles (320km) on a single charge. Steve LeVine, author of 'The Powerhouse,' a book about the automotive battery industry, said on Bloomberg TV Thursday: 'Was GM really going to be able to match Tesla? Apple can.' This latest speculation follows sightings of mysterious camera-mounted cars registered to Apple in the US last week. At least two videos - one recorded in California, another filmed in Florida - suggest the top-secret project is more widespread than first thought. And rumours range from a Street View-style mapping service to an electric car that will rival Tesla or a self-driving van to rival Google. The Californian footage was sent to MacRumors and shows a silver people-carrier driving down a street in Palo Alto. The Florida recording was filmed on a highway in Coral Springs and uploaded by Apple Insider. This footage shows a white Dodge Caravan fitted with cameras on the roof.\xa0As the filmmaker pulls alongside the van, they wave at the two men inside. The passenger is seen concealing an iPad from view, while the driver points to the camera and drives off. The Florida recording (pictured) was filmed in Coral Springs. This footage shows a white Dodge Caravan fitted with cameras on the roof. As the filmmaker pulls alongside the van, they wave at the two men inside and the passenger is seen concealing an iPad from view. Other reports have spotted the vans in Hawaii and Wisconsin. The latest vans haven't officially been confirmed as belonging to Apple, but the similarities with previous confirmed sightings suggests they are. The far-reaching nature of the project lends more weight to the claims Apple is developing a mapping service. With 12 cameras on top of the car, however, some have said that is too many for it to be a mapping car like Google's Street View. Plus, reports recently claimed Apple has several hundred employees developing an electric car at a secret lab. This project has been dubbed 'Titan'. This Apple research lab was reportedly set up late last year - meaning any car could still be years away - \xa0and is being overseen by Apple designer Sir Jonathan Ive. Apple could, of course, be using the vans for both projects. The Wall Street Journal\xa0added that hundreds of employees are working on the Titan project and boss Tim Cook approved the project close to a year ago. The Californian footage (pictured) was sent to MacRumors and shows a silver people-carrier driving down a street in Palo Alto. These reports followed rumours that Apple was developing a vehicle as part of a project that 'will change the landscape and give Tesla a run for its money.' The claims were made in an email from an unnamed Apple employee. In an interview last year, Apple board member Mickey Drexler said that before his death in 2011, Steve Jobs had considered building a car. An unnamed Apple employee recently hinted that the tech giant is developing a vehicle as part of a project that 'will change the landscape and give Tesla a run for its money.'  It followed sightings of an Apple-owned car fitted with cameras (pictured) in California. In particular, Apple may be working on an electric car to rival Tesla's range (the Tesla P85D is pictured) or\xa0the email could be referring to an advanced iPhone in-car control system that would rival Tesla's software. The head of self-driving cars for Google expects real people to be using them on public roads in two to five years. Chris Urmson said the cars would still be test vehicles, and Google would collect data on how they interact with other vehicles and pedestrians. But Mr Urmson wouldn't give a date for putting driverless cars on roads en masse, saying that the system has to be safe enough to work properly. He told reporters last month at the Automotive News World Congress in Detroit that he wants to reach the point where his test team no longer has to pilot the cars. He told Paul Goldberger: 'Steve Jobs was gonna design an iCar. I think cars have an extraordinary opportunity for cool design.' Alternatively, the Apple employee's email could be referring to an advanced iPhone in-car control system that would rival Tesla's software. The original Dodge van with the equipment on the top was spotted by the blog Claycord in San Francisco. The blog owners apparently asked the driver what he was doing, but he refused to give an answer. The California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) confirmed the vehicle was leased to Apple. Last year, footage emerged of a self-driving Dodge Caravan that looked like the current Apple minivans. When contacted by MailOnline, Apple declined to comment on the car in question or what its purpose was. With 12 cameras on top of the mysterious Apple car, some have said that is too many for it to be a mapping car like Google's Street View (pictured left). Google launched its Street View technology in 2007, and has refined the technology ever since (Street View screenshot near Trafalgar Square in London pictured right) Alternatively, the vehicles spotted in California and Florida could be self-driving cars. The cameras on the mysterious vans could be used to scan the road and help engineers develop autonomous software, for example. If Apple was developing such systems, they would would rival Google's self-driving cars (pictured)\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0,

Please output the summary only, without any other text.\n\nArticle:\nSeven-year-old Faith Lennox never thought she needed a left hand; after all, she couldn't remember losing hers when she was only 9 months old. The 7-year-old,  grabbed the replacement as soon as it came off a 3-D printer on Tuesday in Los Alamitos, California. She put it on and raced off on her bicycle. Later, Faith happily showed off the hand to others, flexing its pink and blue fingers as she gripped her small, stuffed 'Finding Nemo' fish. The prosthetic was constructed overnight at the Build It Workspace studio. It represents a breakthrough in small, lightweight hands that are economical and easy for children to use. Scroll down for video. She doesn't need any help: Faith Lennox, 7, right, smiles as she holds an extra plastic prosthetics part with her newly 3-D printed hand at the Build it Workspace in Los Alamitos, California on Tuesday. A new addition: Faith Lennox, 7, adjusts her newly 3-D printed hand which is the result of an emerging technology that is revolutionizing prosthetics. But when it came to getting one custom made in a day by a 3-D printer, that was a different story. Particularly when she got to pick the colors — her favorite pink, blue and purple, like the ones on the tank top she was wearing. It didn't hurt, either, that the appendage, called a robohand, looks a lot like the pair Marvel superhero Iron Man wears. 'It's really cool!' the otherwise shy little girl said with an exuberant grin as she stood surrounded by high-tech computers in the Build It Workspace in this Orange County suburb on Monday. Build It Workspace is a 3-D printer studio that teaches people to use high-tech printers and provides access to them for projects. It also does commercial printing. She had gotten out of school early to go there with her mother, Nicole, to watch in fascination as her new hand began to take shape. She stood for several minutes transfixed as it slowly moved from computer image to hard-plastic reality. The finished product will be the result of an emerging technology that is revolutionizing prosthetics, said Build It's Mark Lengsfeld, especially for children like Faith, who quickly outgrow expensive prosthetic limbs and have trouble even using them because of their size and weight. Many functions: Faith Lennox, 7, rides her bicycle with her newly 3D printed hand outside the Build it Workspace parking lot  on Tuesday. Cool tricks: Greg Lennox holds a 'Nemo' plastic fish as his daughter Faith grabs it with her newly 3-D printed hand as her mother, Nicole and Build it Workspace president, Mark Lengsfeld, looks on. 'It's an amazing thing to be doing,' the company's president and founder said of making a hand that weighs less than a pound out of the same kind of plastic used in automobile parts. Although Lengsfeld's company has printed out everything from pumps for oil and gas companies to parts for unmanned aerial vehicles, this is the first hand he and his three employees have built. Airwolf 3D, whose printers built Faith's hand, recently cranked out 200 hands for children around the world as part of an international competition to see which company could use the most 3-D printers in one space at one time. Airwolf, with 159 printers going, won by one, said the company's creative director, Tyler Caros, who was keeping watch on Monday as the hard plastic going into Faith's hand slowly unspooled. In love with her hand: Faith Lennox, 7, left, forms a heart with her newly 3D printed hand on Tuesday. Going for a ride: Faith Lennox, 7, adjusts her helmet before riding her bicycle with her newly 3D printed hand outside Build it Workspace in Los Alamitos, California. The oldest of three children, Faith had compartment syndrome when her position during childbirth cut off the flow of blood to her left forearm, irreparably damaging tissue, muscle and bone. After nine months of trying to save the limb, doctors determined they had to amputate just below the elbow. Faith's parents were working with the nonprofit group E-Nable to get her a 3-D-printed hand, but the technology is so new there's a waiting list, her mother said. Then she learned of what Lengsfeld's company could do from a friend whose son visited with his Scout troop. E-Nable provides open-source technology for building the hand, Lengsfeld said, making it economical for anyone with the right printer and a set of instructions to create one. Faith's only costs $50, and when she outgrows it she can easily build a bigger replacement. 'It's been an honor to help her,' he said. The little girl who taught herself to swim at age 3 and surfs with her father already knows what she plans to do when she puts that new hand on. 'Ride my bike!'she said with a big grin. Although she's already a competent rider, she noted that making turns with just one hand can be a little tricky. Family fun: Faith Lennox, 7, left, shows her mother Nicole her newly 3-D printed hand on Tuesday.\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0,

The punishment comes amid recent cases of bad behavior at the University of Oklahoma, Penn State and other schools put fraternities in the national spotlight. University Chancellor Randy Woodson announced that the Tau Chapter of the Pi Kappa Phi Fraternity was disbanded, effective immediately. The fraternity was ordered to immediately vacate its on-campus house. North Carolina State University disbanded Pi Kappa Phi after a book containing sickening jokes about rape and lynching was found by a female student at a restaurant near the school's campus in Raleigh. The notebook included sexist and racially-insensitive comments like: 'That tree is so perfect for a lynching' Besides the lynching line, the book contained the phrase: 'It will be short and painful, just like when I rape you' Woodson said 'I hope today's action makes it clear that there is no place for intolerance, sexism and racism at N.C. State. 'I know the poor behaviors we've seen recently by a few in no way represent the strong character and values of our larger student body. 'N.C. State will work hard to ensure these outlying actions never become accepted or tolerated at our university.' Woodson's announcement comes one week after the notebook containing sexist and racist remarks attributed to Pi Kappa Phi fraternity members was found at a restaurant near campus. The book and its contents were then featured by a local television station. A different N.C. State fraternity, Alpha Tau Omega, was suspended earlier this month after details of drug paraphernalia seized from its house surfaced in a search warrant related to a sexual assault allegation. N.C. State responded by temporarily suspending all social events involving alcohol for more than 20 fraternities on campus. Frat said:\xa0'These statements are inconsistent with the values of Pi Kappa Phi and will not be tolerated' The book was turned in by student Katie Perry, who said she found it while working at the restaurant. Woodson also called Wednesday for a 'thorough review' of the university's Greek system. The review will assess whether fraternities and sororities are meeting the core values and high behavioral standards of the university, and will focus on a range of issues including sexual misconduct, substance abuse, and diversity and inclusion. Pi Kappa Phi accepted Wednesday's punishment and may be allowed to return to campus with new membership in 2018. 'We appreciate the support and collaboration with the N.C. State administration,' said Mark E. Timmes, the chief executive of Pi Kappa Phi. 'Together, we acted quickly to address this situation and reaffirm our commitment to maintaining an environment where everyone feels safe, respected, and valued.' Pi Kappa Phi had earlier suspended its chapter at N.C. State until the investigation concerning the green book found at a restaurant near the school's Raleigh campus was completed. The contents of the Pi Kappa Phi notebook were first broadcast by television station\xa0WRAL. The notebook included sexist and racially-insensitive comments like 'If she's hot enough, she doesn't need a pulse.' and 'That tree is so perfect for a lynching.' It also contained the comments: 'It will be short and painful, just like when I rape you' and 'I like little girls.' The book was turned in by student Katie Perry, who said she found it while working at the restaurant. She said: 'The contents were horrible. 'I wanted to make sure everybody knew this was going on so it could be corrected. 'Frats are looked up to, but this is what they are doing. Pi Kappa Phi accepted Wednesday's punishment and may be allowed to return to campus with new membership in 2018. Alpha Tau Omega's NC State chapter was suspended earlier this month amid allegations of sexual assault. 'I hope other fraternities are disgusted. 'I hope that if they do have this sort of thing going on in theirs, that they'll realize, whether they want to or not, that they should change, that they shouldn't promote this kind of behavior.' Pi Kappa Phi chief executive officer Mark Timmes earlier called the quotes'reprehensible and unacceptable'. He said: 'We have sent staff to Raleigh to investigate the circumstances of the situation. 'These statements are inconsistent with the values of Pi Kappa Phi and will not be tolerated. 'We are working closely with the university and have instructed our students to cooperate fully with all investigation efforts. 'We appreciate the university's collaboration in quickly addressing the situation.' N.C. State's alcohol ban doesn't apply to historically black Greek organizations or the Multicultural Greek Council. In announcing the alcohol crackdown, N.C. State said the school also plans training on diversity for chapters and other measures to increase accountability. In the Alpha Tau Omega investigation, a woman called police March 1 to say she was sexually assaulted at the fraternity house. She also told officers drugs - including cocaine, ecstasy and prescription pills - were being sold out of the house. Campus police Sgt. J.P. Dye seized drug paraphernalia, a scale and white powder in a small bag during a search of the empty house. Wynn Smiley, Alpha Tau Omega's national chief executive officer, said the fraternity had kicked out a pledge who had white powder and other drug paraphernalia in his room. The student had been associated with the organization for less than a month, Smiley said. He said the national organization conducted its own investigation with a lawyer and other alumni advisers, and the organization believes the woman was exaggerating about drugs being sold and the level of drug activity. He also questioned her credibility on the sexual assault allegation. Smiley said: 'It just didn't line up with what we were finding out.' Kayle Graham, a junior psychology major at NC State, said racism and sexism among students is sad because the younger generation's attitude indicates where the country is heading. She said: 'It's unfortunate that at a college level, students aren't as mature and socially aware as one would like them to be.'\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0,

The pair are both set to start as Spurs travel to Queens Park Rangers on Saturday and are the in-form English strikers in the Premier League. And Pochettino knows that both could have a future for Roy Hodgson's national team. Mauricio Pochettino believes Charlie Austin and Harry Kane (pictured) could form a partnership for England. QPR striker Charlie Austin shoots against Arsenal at Loftus Road in their last Premier League match. Both in-form strikers Kane and Austin are set to start when Spurs travel to QPR on Saturday. 'Charlie is a very good player,' he said. 'In football you never know - why not? They're both very good players.' Tottenham will discuss Kane's workload with the FA in the next month. Spurs - who insists Emmanuel Adebayor still has a future at the club - would rather Kane has a rest at the end of the season. But FA technical director Dan Asheprth wants the striker to travel with Gareth Southgate's Under 21s to the Czech Republic for the European Championships as well as turning out for the senior side. 'I always protect the player,' Pochettino added. Spurs are looking to break into the top four, starting with the trip to Loftus Road - although Pochettino refused to set any targets in terms of points, also suggesting some of the youth team who played against Chelsea on Thursday night could be handed debuts before the end of the season. Tottenham manager Pochettino refused to set any targets in terms of points in the Premier League. Tottenham will discuss Kane's workload with the Football Association in the next month. Football data analysts BSports predict that a Spurs win at QPR is the most likely outcome on Saturday. 'Its not easy because seven or eight teams are fighting for that. We need to go step by step. We're in a good process. My worry now is to improve,' he said. 'We have 11 games to finish the season. It's important to be solid. 'We expect a tough game. They're a strong team. It's a London derby and the three points are important. The squad is fully fit. We need to be ready because it's a difficult game. 'We want to finish the season strong. We have time to work hard now and to be consistent.'\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=128, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=False, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: [128000, 9370, 5730, 553, 279, 2768, 3754, 4652, 304, 220, 4386, 11460, 13, 5321, 2612, 279, 12399, 1193, 11, 2085, 904, 1023, 1495, 382, 17064, 512, 44, 4202, 11518, 393, 5059, 7211, 3394, 13919, 25972, 19816, 323, 14253, 46656, 1436, 1376, 264, 15664, 369, 9635, 304, 279, 3938, 13, 578, 6857, 527, 2225, 743, 311, 1212, 439, 46142, 5944, 311, 28162, 5657, 34287, 389, 7884, 323, 527, 279, 304, 8627, 6498, 6076, 27269, 304, 279, 20210, 9130, 13, 1628, 393, 5059, 7211, 3394, 8964, 430, 2225, 1436, 617, 264, 3938, 369, 11284, 83984, 942, 596, 5426, 2128, 13, 34492, 11518, 393, 5059, 7211, 3394, 13919, 25972, 19816, 323, 14253, 46656, 320, 69389, 8, 1436, 1376, 264, 15664, 369, 9635, 13, 1229, 6616, 45041, 25972, 19816, 44727, 2403, 33102, 520, 84254, 355, 9728, 304, 872, 1566, 20210, 9130, 2489, 13, 11995, 304, 8627, 6076, 27269, 46656, 323, 19816, 527, 743, 311, 1212, 994, 46142, 5944, 311, 1229, 6616, 389, 7884, 13, 364, 73728, 374, 264, 1633, 1695, 2851, 2965, 568, 1071, 13, 364, 644, 9141, 499, 2646, 1440, 482, 3249, 539, 30, 2435, 2351, 2225, 1633, 1695, 4311, 3238, 56648, 690, 4358, 46656, 596, 54696, 449, 279, 15358, 304, 279, 1828, 2305, 13, 46142, 482, 889, 43446, 61544, 362, 39035, 352, 269, 2103, 706, 264, 3938, 520, 279, 6469, 482, 1053, 4856, 46656, 706, 264, 2800, 520, 279, 842, 315, 279, 3280, 13, 2030, 15358, 11156, 7690, 11824, 76279, 652, 339, 6944, 279, 45041, 311, 5944, 449, 88147, 4987, 25623, 596, 9636, 220, 1691, 82, 311, 279, 34250, 5545, 369, 279, 7665, 48854, 439, 1664, 439, 13353, 704, 369, 279, 10195, 3185, 13, 364, 40, 2744, 6144, 279, 2851, 2965, 393, 5059, 7211, 3394, 3779, 13, 46142, 527, 3411, 311, 1464, 1139, 279, 1948, 3116, 11, 6041, 449, 279, 8577, 311, 84254, 355, 9728, 482, 8051, 393, 5059, 7211, 3394, 16436, 311, 743, 904, 11811, 304, 3878, 315, 3585, 11, 1101, 23377, 1063, 315, 279, 12822, 2128, 889, 6476, 2403, 27616, 389, 7950, 3814, 1436, 387, 23415, 4316, 6256, 1603, 279, 842, 315, 279, 3280, 13, 56648, 6783, 393, 5059, 7211, 3394, 16436, 311, 743, 904, 11811, 304, 3878, 315, 3585, 304, 279, 20210, 9130, 13, 56648, 690, 4358, 46656, 596, 54696, 449, 279, 21424, 10229, 304, 279, 1828, 2305, 13, 21424, 828, 31499, 28718, 3476, 7168, 430, 264, 46142, 3243, 520, 1229, 6616, 374, 279, 1455, 4461, 15632, 389, 7884, 13, 364, 37220, 539, 4228, 1606, 8254, 477, 8223, 7411, 527, 11039, 369, 430, 13, 1226, 1205, 311, 733, 3094, 555, 3094, 13, 1226, 2351, 304, 264, 1695, 1920, 13, 3092, 11196, 1457, 374, 311, 7417, 2965, 568, 1071, 13, 364, 1687, 617, 220, 806, 3953, 311, 6381, 279, 3280, 13, 1102, 596, 3062, 311, 387, 6573, 13, 364, 1687, 1755, 264, 11292, 1847, 13, 2435, 2351, 264, 3831, 2128, 13, 1102, 596, 264, 7295, 91770, 323, 279, 2380, 3585, 527, 3062, 13, 578, 19037, 374, 7373, 5052, 13, 1226, 1205, 311, 387, 5644, 1606, 433, 596, 264, 5107, 1847, 13, 364, 1687, 1390, 311, 6381, 279, 3280, 3831, 13, 1226, 617, 892, 311, 990, 2653, 1457, 323, 311, 387, 13263, 22438, 19791, 25], prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

And the bride even wore her strapless dress in the sub-zero temperatures, while her groom wore – what else? – a penguin suit! But the Chinese couple’s antics have brought anything but best wishes back in their homeland, where their behaviour has been deemed an embarrassment, according to the People’s Daily. White wedding: There were no cold feet for this  couple - who posed up after their ceremony in Antarctica. Walking down the icicle: While  friends and family went for padded jackets, the bride wore a strapless dress. Snow regrets: The couple had the time of their lives - but these photos prompted frustration back home. The nation is acutely aware of its reputation for tourists behaving badly abroad and anything that can be seen to reinforce the stereotype is often widely condemned. With a rapidly-growing wealthy elite, China already sends more tourists to Antarctica than any country in the world apart from the U.S. and Australia. According to International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators, 37 Chinese tourists visited the continent between 2003 and 2004. Ten years later that number had exploded to 3,328. This group was spotted by a Chinese photographer who traveled to the untouched wilderness on assignment - and he found them chasing penguins and jumping into groups of the birds. Irresponsible? Chinese citizens are keen to avoid anything that paints them as reckless eco-tourists. Souvenir: Photographers claim to have witnessed tourists getting so close to penguins, they scare them off. Joking around: These men brave the cold as they visit Antarctica's Paradise Bay in the middle of'summer' Internet users in China reacted angrily, with some suggesting the next stop would be taking inappropriate pictures on Mars. A photographer from Chinanews.com took pictures of some Chinese tourists exhibiting what he described as 'pitiful behaviour'. The photographer claimed that the 'uncivilised phenomenon happened constantly'.

Recording the encounter at home, the video maker waits poised with his hand on the computer mouse as the little mammal named Ozzy watches. After flicking his thumb a few times he gets the weasel’s attention and invites the onslaught from his cute and cuddly attacker. The intrigued weasel comes over to its owner after he twiddles his thumb in the hope of getting its attention. Diving at his thumb, the weasel rolls underneath it and begins nibbling on it as it curls itself up into a ball. Before retreating, looking around and repeating the process –\xa0this time clinging on to the thumb. Spinning onto its back, Ozzy casually looks at the camera and bares its teeth before flipping back onto all fours with great agility and attacking the man’s hand once more. Seconds out, round one! The weasel feels out its opponent's thumb before springing into action. Retreating behind the computer’s speaker, the weasel runs back and forward in between its rough-and-tumble. Before momentarily choosing to ignore the thumb and come right up to the camera to stare down its lens curiously. After more of the same, Ozzy runs off behind the keyboard and the video maker is left twiddling his fingers. The cute and cuddly attacker rolls onto its back while enjoying some rough-and-tumble with its owner. According to the owner, the weasel is fully grown and always in the mood for fun and games. But, writing on his YouTube channel, he also noted that weasel’s should not be considered pets. He wrote: ‘They hate being locked up, they're not friendly when hungry. Don't get one. Seriously. Ozzy is a special case rescue baby. Cute, but deadly.’ Rolling onto its back, the weasel takes a break from fighting to look down the camera and bare its teeth. The least weasel, as Ozzy's type is known, is native to Eurasia, North America and North Africa, though it has been introduced elsewhere. Despite the mammal’s small size, it has the capability of killing a rabbit five to ten times its own weight. And a mouse (and a thumb) is clearly no match for it either. The adorable animal has become so popular on YouTube, its owner has even set up a Facebook page in honour of Ozzy The Weasel, complete with videos, pictures and updates. The weasel called Ozzy latches onto its owner's thumb and begins giving it a little nibble.\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=128, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=False, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: [128000, 9370, 5730, 553, 279, 2768, 3754, 4652, 304, 220, 4386, 11460, 13, 5321, 2612, 279, 12399, 1193, 11, 2085, 904, 1023, 1495, 382, 17064, 512, 32, 584, 84597, 19168, 430, 433, 374, 810, 315, 264, 23810, 1109, 264, 8814, 994, 433, 32098, 1202, 6506, 505, 5737, 389, 813, 6500, 13, 61647, 279, 13123, 520, 2162, 11, 279, 2835, 25214, 48036, 54946, 449, 813, 1450, 389, 279, 6500, 8814, 439, 279, 2697, 36041, 278, 7086, 36704, 4341, 32860, 13, 4740, 29447, 287, 813, 25015, 264, 2478, 3115, 568, 5334, 279, 584, 84597, 753, 6666, 323, 45510, 279, 88792, 505, 813, 19369, 323, 65245, 398, 31810, 13, 578, 69118, 584, 84597, 4131, 927, 311, 1202, 6506, 1306, 568, 4483, 78555, 813, 25015, 304, 279, 3987, 315, 3794, 1202, 6666, 13, 423, 2299, 520, 813, 25015, 11, 279, 584, 84597, 28473, 30456, 433, 323, 12302, 31385, 9894, 389, 433, 439, 433, 90049, 5196, 709, 1139, 264, 5041, 13, 13538, 2160, 73910, 11, 3411, 2212, 323, 40916, 279, 1920, 1389, 4194, 576, 892, 97458, 389, 311, 279, 25015, 13, 3165, 20353, 8800, 1202, 1203, 11, 36704, 4341, 65714, 5992, 520, 279, 6382, 323, 293, 5518, 1202, 18311, 1603, 65761, 1203, 8800, 682, 90720, 449, 2294, 67741, 323, 23664, 279, 893, 753, 1450, 3131, 810, 13, 62083, 704, 11, 4883, 832, 0, 578, 584, 84597, 11321, 704, 1202, 15046, 596, 25015, 1603, 10683, 287, 1139, 1957, 13, 10608, 73910, 4920, 279, 6500, 753, 19114, 11, 279, 584, 84597, 8640, 1203, 323, 4741, 304, 1990, 1202, 11413, 9976, 2442, 23568, 13, 13538, 99497, 19301, 311, 10240, 279, 25015, 323, 2586, 1314, 709, 311, 279, 6382, 311, 46943, 1523, 1202, 18848, 2917, 13610, 13, 4740, 810, 315, 279, 1890, 11, 36704, 4341, 8640, 1022, 4920, 279, 13939, 323, 279, 2835, 25214, 374, 2163, 4483, 1810, 2785, 813, 19779, 13, 578, 19369, 323, 65245, 398, 31810, 28473, 8800, 1202, 1203, 1418, 22128, 1063, 11413, 9976, 2442, 23568, 449, 1202, 6506, 13, 10771, 311, 279, 6506, 11, 279, 584, 84597, 374, 7373, 15042, 323, 2744, 304, 279, 20247, 369, 2523, 323, 3953, 13, 2030, 11, 4477, 389, 813, 13674, 5613, 11, 568, 1101, 10555, 430, 584, 84597, 753, 1288, 539, 387, 6646, 26159, 13, 1283, 6267, 25, 3451, 7009, 12491, 1694, 16447, 709, 11, 814, 2351, 539, 11919, 994, 30056, 13, 4418, 956, 636, 832, 13, 57606, 13, 36704, 4341, 374, 264, 3361, 1162, 17629, 8945, 13, 58639, 11, 719, 25114, 14639, 46048, 8800, 1202, 1203, 11, 279, 584, 84597, 5097, 264, 1464, 505, 11039, 311, 1427, 1523, 279, 6382, 323, 12743, 1202, 18311, 13, 578, 3325, 584, 84597, 11, 439, 36704, 4341, 596, 955, 374, 3967, 11, 374, 10068, 311, 88177, 689, 11, 4892, 5270, 323, 4892, 10384, 11, 3582, 433, 706, 1027, 11784, 18403, 13, 18185, 279, 36041, 278, 753, 2678, 1404, 11, 433, 706, 279, 23099, 315, 13419, 264, 39824, 4330, 311, 5899, 3115, 1202, 1866, 4785, 13, 1628, 264, 8814, 320, 438, 264, 25015, 8, 374, 9539, 912, 2489, 369, 433, 3060, 13, 578, 41708, 10065, 706, 3719, 779, 5526, 389, 13674, 11, 1202, 6506, 706, 1524, 743, 709, 264, 5690, 2199, 304, 34662, 315, 36704, 4341, 578, 1226, 84597, 11, 4686, 449, 6946, 11, 9364, 323, 9013, 13, 578, 584, 84597, 2663, 36704, 4341, 326, 9296, 8800, 1202, 6506, 596, 25015, 323, 12302, 7231, 433, 264, 2697, 31385, 901, 382, 19791, 25], prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

Five of the airports servicing London - London City, Gatwick, Heathrow, Luton and Stansted - and also Edinburgh and Manchester airports feature in the top ten most expensive airports for parking across the globe, with London City Airport topping the leaderboard at £315 per week. In many cases that may be more than the total price of the holiday booked. London City Airport's proximity in the heart of London means the site urges travellers to use public transport if possible - it's worth considering when parking can be as much as £315 per week. How the airports around the world ranked where it came to car parking. Even when booked in advance, a week's parking at London City is twice the price of New York's JFK Airport - and nearly three times the cost of parking at Tokyo International Airport, research by Justpark.com has discovered. Parking rip-offs are not only suffered by holidaymakers leaving their cars at the airport while travelling abroad. Those collecting friends and family from airports are also charged extortionate amounts for short-term parking, paying £15 for 1-2 hours at London City and £12 at Heathrow. Following London City int he rankings is London Heathrow, where it costs an average of £167 a week to park. The UK dominance is broken as Sydney enters in third spot - parking there for seven days costs around £138. Parking at Heathrow Airport was found to be the second most expensive in the world at £167 per week. Anthony Eskinazi, founder of JustPark, said: 'We've long known that airport parking is overpriced across the country, but all the same these new revelations are remarkable. 'Finding that seven of the world's ten most expensive airports are here in the UK shows the extent of the problem we are facing.' You could...

He added: 'When people are paying more for their airport parking than their flights, something needs to change. We want to redress this balance and make airport parking more affordable.' The high cost of airport parking in the UK has led holiday-makers to seek alternative, more affordable options. Over 600,000 drivers use the app and website JustPark to find and book parking spaces on local residential driveways, rather than paying airport prices. More than 200 Heathrow homeowners are renting out their driveways for as little as £21.50 per week through JustPark, giving holidaymakers an 85 per cent saving on official airport parking and putting money back into local people's pockets. A spokesperson for London City Airport (LCY) told MailOnline Travel:  'LCY is unique in its close proximity to central London and limited space for parking. 'We encourage passengers to travel via public transport, using the airport's own DLR station, and 70 per cent do so. 'For those who do choose to drive, we offer free drop-off and parking savings of up to 40 per cent by booking online in advance.' A spokesperson for London City Airport has urged passengers to use public transport to the site. And\xa0Sean Hagger, commercial director at Holiday Extras, told MailOnline Travel how it is important for holidaymakers to book their car parking as early as possible. 'The figures given are rather misleading, he said. Here are car parking facilities available outside of the airport, that may be more attractive in price... Heathrow: https://www.justpark.com/uk/parking/heathrow/heathrow-airport/. London City: https://www.justpark.com/uk/parking/london/london-city-airport/. Gatwick: https://www.justpark.com/uk/parking/redhill/gatwick-airport/. Stansted: https://www.justpark.com/uk/parking/stansted/stansted-airport/. 'If you turn up on the day to park your car for a week or two at an airport designed for business travellers, as London City is, then you will be charged for the privilege. 'The reality is that very few holiday travellers do this; I'm pleased to say that Brits tend to have more foresight. 'It pays to book ahead – even just a couple of days. Looking on our website I can see that booking a week's Meet & Greet parking at London City, starting this Sunday, would cost £105 per week. 'Likewise, parking at London Heathrow for a week from March 6 at Terminal 2's official long-stay car park would cost £75.80. This price drops as low as £52.95 if you use other long-term parking options. 'If you're just a tiny bit organised, you can save hundreds of pounds.'\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0,

But now, the 28-year-old, who arrived in Spain following a £75million move from Liverpool, is preparing for his first El Clasico at the Nou Camp. It's a game that could shape the La Liga title race this season and Suarez, who made his Barcelona debut against Real Madrid earlier in the season, is nothing but excited. Suarez revealed in an interview with Barca TV: 'I never imagined playing in El Clasico. I used to watch the games and look at photos and I used to say how incredible to play in it was. 'Now it's time to enjoy it and make the most of the moment. I was at the 5-0 game and the 1-1 draw in the Champions League (2010/2011). As a fan you enjoy it a lot.' Speaking about making his debut in Spanish football's biggest game, Suarez said: 'I was focused on my nervousness about coming back to play. Lionel Messi, Suarez and Neymar Jnr have netted 55 La Liga goals between them this season. 'Aside from it being El Clasico, it was important for me. I didn't enjoy it as you should enjoy El Clasico, let's hope I can do it this time.' Suarez has become an important part of a three-pronged attack at Barcelona since his arrival and has played some of the best form of his career. However, the Uruguayan striker remains self-critical and is only concentrating on being happy on the pitch and helping the squad. Suarez attempts to score past Manchester City's goalkeeper Joe Hart during a Champions League clash. Suarez said: 'I don't know if this is my best moment of form. I do know that I am happy, I feel like I am helping the team and that allows me to be relaxed. 'It isn't difficult to have an understanding with players of Barcelona's quality. 'But we have to continue in that vein, showing that we want to help the team and that nobody wants to steal the limelight, only to achieve big things.'

It was thanks to the quick thinking of her husband, Iain, that Kathryn Grainger was given the treatment she needed right away to survive having a stroke at such a young age. He spotted the signs her health was in serious danger when she woke up with a headache at 4am in July 2008. Kathryn had made enough of a recovery to walk down the aisle in 2012 to tie the knot with Iain. Kathryn, now 29, from Durham, recalls: \'I woke up thinking I was having a bad headache but Iain said, "You\'re having a stroke". \'To be honest I didn\'t know what a stroke was until I had mine. I was very confused and didn\'t know what was going on.\' The fashion university student was taken to hospital and put into an induced coma to undergo surgery to remove her skull and reduce the swelling on her brain. But doctors warned her devastated boyfriend, then aged 24, and her parents Leslie and Miriam, that they could not be sure if she would be permanently brain damaged - and warned them she may never walk or talk again. Kathryn and Iain, pictured in 2010, at Berlin Zoo, one year after she suffered a stroke aged just 22. Kathryn pictured as a child with her elder brother Christopher Thompson. Kathryn said of that difficult time: \'When I first woke up from my coma, I couldn\'t sit up, walk, speak or move. \'I could just about write with my right hand and couldn\'t see properly in my left eye. \'Although I was in shock I kept thinking I\'d be okay to go back to university in September. \'I had no idea how bad I was. Iain knew though because he saw me with tubes and wires coming out of my head. He can\'t talk about it because he gets upset.\' Kathryn\'s parents and Iain, who she had met through friends two years before her stroke, were determined to support her and nurse her back to health. She was also determined to regain her health and independence and didn\'t want to give up on her degree. Kathryn and Iain pictured with her father Leslie and mother Miriam at their wedding in 2012. Kathryn defied doctors by walking down the aisle on her big day with Iain. Kathryn said: \'I stayed in the high dependency unit for two weeks. I was fed through a tube in my nose for months and then I went on to pureed food. \'The doctors told my parents I may not be able to walk again or talk. They didn\'t think I would get out of my chair, but I proved them wrong. \'I had physiotherapy, occupational and speech therapy. Slowly I re-learnt how to do things. I was really frustrated, as I\'d lost the use of my left arm, as a fashion student that wasn\'t easy but the university did everything they could to help me and I graduated.\' When she left hospital, Kathryn and Iain moved in with her parents in Durham and she began to make progress with their help, and that of Different Strokes in East End Pool, Newcastle,\xa0a project using cash raised by Red Nose Day to support stroke survivors. When Iain, a senior analyst in complaints, proposed on Christmas Eve 2011 Kathryn was even more determined to be able to walk again. The happy couple on their honeymoon in Paris in 2013. Iain and Kathryn’s first trip to Paris in 2009 - before she suffered a stroke. \'All I could think of when I came out of hospital was that I wanted to walk down the street holding his hand again and we wanted to walked down the aisle arm-in-arm,\' she said. She was able to do just that when they tied the knot a year later. Speaking about their big day, Kathryn said: \'I was in a wheelchair for five months after my stroke and I thought I would never walk again. \'Walking down the aisle with my dad on my wedding day, I felt so many different emotions. It\'s hard to describe the feeling but all I can really say is that it was one of the happiest moments of my entire life. \'My dad gave an amazing father of the bride speech. He said: "After Kathryn had her stroke, most young lads would have left because she was so poorly but Iain stuck by my daughter and looked after her throughout." \'Iain has really has supported me throughout everything; marrying him was the best day of my life.\' The signs and symptoms of a stroke vary from person to person but usually begin suddenly. As different parts of your brain control different parts of your body, your symptoms will depend on the part of your brain affected and the extent of the damage. The main stroke symptoms can be remembered with the word FAST: Face-Arms-Speech-Time. The couple have now moved into their own home in Durham. Despite having to deal with having a stroke at such a young age, Kathryn says she doesn\'t feel sorry for herself. \'I\'m a pretty positive person. I haven\'t let it get me down. It could have been so much worse,\' she said. As well as the support of Iain and her family, she said Different Strokes made a huge contribution to her recovery so now she\'s urging people to support Red Nose Day on 13 March to raise money for such worthwhile projects. \'I found a Different Strokes group on Facebook and decided to go along. It was the first time I had spoken to people who had had a stroke. It was really helpful and I got some good advice from a physio and took part in gentle group exercises,\' Kathryn said. \'Six years on I still have some things to improve on, like my speech. I\'d love to be able to raise public awareness about strokes. \'It\'s the leading cause of disabilities but I didn\'t have a clue and you have to deal with it so quickly.\' Red Nose Day is back on Friday 13th March. Money raised this Red Nose Day will help to transform lives here in the UK and across Africa.

Please output the summary only, without any other text.\n\nArticle:\nChristina Lagogiannis, 12, was diagnosed with osteosarcoma, a rare bone cancer, in January 2014. The family of a 12-year-old girl who has undergone eight surgeries in the last 12 months to treat an aggressive bone cancer has raised over $100,000 to help get her to Germany for life changing treatment. Christina Lagogiannis, from East Bentley in Melbourne, was diagnosed with osteosarcoma in January of last year. She endured more than six months of chemotherapy and a string of operations\xa0before being told that her cancer has progressed to stage four. \'The worst part is when your own child comes up to you and says: "am I going to die, mum?",\' Christina\'s mother, Nayree Lagogiannis, told Daily Mail Australia. \'She had already Googled everything, let me tell you, but I said "I will promise you that I will do everything in my power to help you get better and I will not let you die".\' Mrs Lagogiannis watched as her daughter took on a full knee and femur replacement, further surgery on her knee due to infection, a biopsy and then keyhole surgery on her right lung followed by three more open surgeries on her lungs to remove a number of lesions. Scroll down for video. Christina spent six months receiving chemotherapy and has undergone eight surgeries since her diagnosis. \'The worst part is when your own child comes up to you and says: "am I going to die, mum?",\' Christina\'s mother, Nayree Lagogiannis (right), said. The 40-year-old mother-of-three said she was furious at the lack of options provided by the Australian healthcare system for her daughter\'s ongoing treatment -- comprising more chemotherapy and more surgeries. \'They are offering her chemotherapy with no percentage rate of remission or survival,\' Mrs Lagogiannis\xa0said. \'I\'m not going to let them guinea pig her. I don\'t need that. She\'s not going to have any more of that poison running through her veins. \'Each time they go in they have to take out a piece of her lung, and then there\'s only so much of the lung they can remove and that\'s when they will put her on palliative care. I\'m not going to let that be the last alternative. Mrs Lagogiannis watched as her daughter took on a full knee and femur replacement, further surgery on her knee due to infection, a biopsy and then keyhole surgery on her right lung followed by three more open surgeries on her lungs to remove a number of lesions. Christina\'s mother said she was furious at the lack of options in the Australian healthcare system for her daughter. Christina will be treated at the Medical Centre in Cologne in Germany where she will receive\xa0hypothermia and dendritic cell vaccinations - both of which are unavailable in Australia. \'I am very frustrated. There is so much funding for things like breast cancer, but the smaller cancers and less common things that have also been around for many, many years - the treatment hasn\'t changed for more than 30 years.\' It was her promise to her daughter that led Mrs Lagogiannis to research treatment options available in Germany. She came across the Medical Centre in Cologne which offers hypothermia and dendritic cell vaccinations, both of which are not available in Australia, and promises a \'95 per cent chance that she would either go into full remission or 50 per cent remission,\' Mrs Lagogiannis said. Christina\'s family said they have been left completely overwhelmed by all the support they have received from their community which has led them to raise $100,000. Christina (pictured with her little sister and older brother) \xa0will travel to Germany with her family this week, where she will receive the $80,000 treatment over the next eight weeks. After raising over $100,000 through their My Cause page and by running a number of local fundraisers, Christina has been given the opportunity to travel to Germany with her family where she will receive the $80,000 treatment over the next eight weeks. Christina\'s family said they have been left completely overwhelmed by all the support they have received from their community. \'She\'s one tough cookie let me tell you and she makes everyone else around her stronger too because of her strength,\'\xa0Mrs Lagogiannis said of her brave daughter. \'She\'s full steam ahead, saying "I just want to be healthy and live my life". That\'s all we want.\'\n\nSummary:', params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None,
