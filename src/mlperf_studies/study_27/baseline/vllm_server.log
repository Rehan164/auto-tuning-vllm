Jermell Blackman of Westbury, New York, took his dog in after he was concerned about how much weight the animal had lost and thinking it had been poisoned, at which point it was discovered the severely underweight dog had been eating wood and plastic. What's more, the dog was filthy, covered in sores and so cold that its temperature did not register on a thermometer. Jermell Blackman (above) was charged with misdemeanor animal abuse on Monday after one of his dogs, Scotia, was found underweight, covered in sores, and so hungry it had begun eating wood and plastic. Blackman also bred and sold dogs to friends, frequently posting photos of the animals alongside his email address and phone number (above) Blackman (left with one of his dogs) bred Scotia with another dog last year, and was selling one of the resulting pups (right) in December for $2,000 plus shipping. Newsday reports that the 2-year-old dog Scotia, a pit bull-terrier mix, also had a heart rate that was one-half to one-third to what a normal dog's heart rate should be. After almost an hour trying to save the dog, it was euthanized. Blackman, 34, was arraigned Monday on misdemeanor animal abuse and released soon after. According to his Facebook page, Blackman also bred and sold dogs to friends, frequently posting photos of the animals alongside his email address and phone number. He even had his own Facebook and Instagram accounts for his business, called Trucklife Bullies. Blackman bred Scotia with another dog last year, and was selling one of the resulting pups in December for $2,000 plus shipping.\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=128, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=False, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: [128000, 9370, 5730, 553, 279, 2768, 3754, 4652, 304, 220, 4386, 11460, 13, 5321, 2612, 279, 12399, 1193, 11, 2085, 904, 1023, 1495, 382, 17064, 512, 32, 893, 706, 1027, 11684, 449, 10065, 11737, 1306, 4737, 813, 5679, 311, 279, 82340, 13, 622, 4289, 616, 5348, 1543, 315, 4410, 20176, 11, 1561, 4356, 11, 3952, 813, 5679, 304, 1306, 568, 574, 11920, 922, 1268, 1790, 4785, 279, 10065, 1047, 5675, 323, 7422, 433, 1047, 1027, 71598, 11, 520, 902, 1486, 433, 574, 11352, 279, 35906, 1234, 4870, 5679, 1047, 1027, 12459, 7732, 323, 12466, 13, 3639, 596, 810, 11, 279, 5679, 574, 78442, 11, 9960, 304, 779, 417, 323, 779, 9439, 430, 1202, 9499, 1550, 539, 4254, 389, 264, 93297, 13, 622, 4289, 616, 5348, 1543, 320, 49532, 8, 574, 11684, 449, 59092, 10065, 11737, 389, 7159, 1306, 832, 315, 813, 12875, 11, 63966, 11, 574, 1766, 1234, 4870, 11, 9960, 304, 779, 417, 11, 323, 779, 30056, 433, 1047, 22088, 12459, 7732, 323, 12466, 13, 5348, 1543, 1101, 55187, 323, 6216, 12875, 311, 4885, 11, 14134, 17437, 7397, 315, 279, 10099, 16662, 813, 2613, 2686, 323, 4641, 1396, 320, 49532, 8, 5348, 1543, 320, 2414, 449, 832, 315, 813, 12875, 8, 55187, 63966, 449, 2500, 5679, 1566, 1060, 11, 323, 574, 11486, 832, 315, 279, 13239, 90821, 320, 1315, 8, 304, 6790, 369, 400, 17, 11, 931, 5636, 11862, 13, 5513, 1316, 6821, 430, 279, 220, 17, 4771, 6418, 5679, 63966, 11, 264, 20428, 17231, 12, 466, 7401, 6651, 11, 1101, 1047, 264, 4851, 4478, 430, 574, 832, 34902, 311, 832, 30277, 311, 1148, 264, 4725, 5679, 596, 4851, 4478, 1288, 387, 13, 4740, 4661, 459, 6596, 4560, 311, 3665, 279, 5679, 11, 433, 574, 81680, 276, 1534, 13, 5348, 1543, 11, 220, 1958, 11, 574, 2961, 71069, 7159, 389, 59092, 10065, 11737, 323, 6004, 5246, 1306, 13, 10771, 311, 813, 5690, 2199, 11, 5348, 1543, 1101, 55187, 323, 6216, 12875, 311, 4885, 11, 14134, 17437, 7397, 315, 279, 10099, 16662, 813, 2613, 2686, 323, 4641, 1396, 13, 1283, 1524, 1047, 813, 1866, 5690, 323, 14318, 9815, 369, 813, 2626, 11, 2663, 34785, 14789, 22353, 552, 13, 5348, 1543, 55187, 63966, 449, 2500, 5679, 1566, 1060, 11, 323, 574, 11486, 832, 315, 279, 13239, 90821, 304, 6790, 369, 400, 17, 11, 931, 5636, 11862, 382, 19791, 25], prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

Please output the summary only, without any other text.\n\nArticle:\nTwo underground craters measuring 400km together in size have been discovered in central Australia, sparking the possibility of a previously unknown asteroid impact event 300 million years ago that caused many species to go extinct. The impact zone was found in the Warburton Basin in two parts, each 200km wide, indicating the meteor that created them split into two before smashing into the earth. Even though it was found two kilometres underground, the impact zone is now the largest in the world, by over 100km. Dr Andrew Glikson from ANU indicates that the size of the asteroid means it could have impacted a mass extinction. The precise age of the crater is not yet known exactly, but researchers think it may be around 300 million years. ‘We cannot define this impact zone in anywhere near the degree of detail we can define the ones exposed on the surface,' Lead Researcher Dr Andrew Glikson of the Australian National University\xa0told Daily Mail Australia. Researchers strongly believe the meteor could have caused the end of many life species on the planet at the time, including the dinosaurs. 'From the size - yes, it could have impacted a mass extinction,' Dr Glikson said. 'Even though we do not know the exact age of the meteor yet, we do know life was very primitive at that time.' The impact zone extends through the Earth's crust which is around 30km thick in Central Australia. The two adjoining craters were thought to have been caused when a meteor split on its approach to Earth, forming two smaller ones each about 10km across. This impact zone, if confirmed, would be the largest in the world. The second largest is the Vredefort crater in South Australia, spanning 300km. This zone survives on the surface of Earth and therefore is easier to find than those underground. The impact zone was flagged after rock affected by heat and pressure was turned into glass. The impact zone was flagged after rock affected by heat and pressure, consequently being turned into glass was discovered, also known as shock metamorphism. The features of this metamorphism show that material was dramatically thrown out of the area in a span of more than 200km, indicating the possibility of a mass extinction. After using geothermal research to look at the internal heat of the earth and seismic data to see the vibrations of the earth's surface, the team of geophysicists released high velocity shocks two kilometres underground by drilling. The impact zone was found in the Warburton basin in Central Australia and spans 400 kilometres. Scientists have been using information from a major 2010 discovery that showed a large meteorite strike 66 million years ago wiped out the dinosaurs. A plume of ash was sent up into the air from the impact and sediment from this collision is found in rocks around the world today. However, none of this sediment has been discovered in 300 million-year-old samples indicating that this site could be older. Further studies of the geochemistry and composition of the impact site are in progress.\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=128, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=False, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: [128000, 9370, 5730, 553, 279, 2768, 3754, 4652, 304, 220, 4386, 11460, 13, 5321, 2612, 279, 12399, 1193, 11, 2085, 904, 1023, 1495, 382, 17064, 512, 11874, 26326, 1589, 11796, 30090, 220, 3443, 16400, 3871, 304, 1404, 617, 1027, 11352, 304, 8792, 8494, 11, 100082, 279, 13336, 315, 264, 8767, 9987, 55479, 5536, 1567, 220, 3101, 3610, 1667, 4227, 430, 9057, 1690, 9606, 311, 733, 69918, 13, 578, 5536, 10353, 574, 1766, 304, 279, 5111, 11490, 783, 61358, 304, 1403, 5596, 11, 1855, 220, 1049, 16400, 7029, 11, 19392, 279, 42142, 430, 3549, 1124, 6859, 1139, 1403, 1603, 83588, 1139, 279, 9578, 13, 7570, 3582, 433, 574, 1766, 1403, 52957, 26326, 11, 279, 5536, 10353, 374, 1457, 279, 7928, 304, 279, 1917, 11, 555, 927, 220, 1041, 16400, 13, 2999, 13929, 480, 7792, 942, 505, 2147, 52, 15151, 430, 279, 1404, 315, 279, 55479, 3445, 433, 1436, 617, 40028, 264, 3148, 52609, 13, 578, 24473, 4325, 315, 279, 75807, 374, 539, 3686, 3967, 7041, 11, 719, 12074, 1781, 433, 1253, 387, 2212, 220, 3101, 3610, 1667, 13, 3451, 1687, 4250, 7124, 420, 5536, 10353, 304, 12660, 3221, 279, 8547, 315, 7872, 584, 649, 7124, 279, 6305, 15246, 389, 279, 7479, 2965, 30982, 8483, 261, 2999, 13929, 480, 7792, 942, 315, 279, 13673, 5165, 3907, 108135, 820, 13690, 15219, 8494, 13, 59250, 16917, 4510, 279, 42142, 1436, 617, 9057, 279, 842, 315, 1690, 2324, 9606, 389, 279, 11841, 520, 279, 892, 11, 2737, 279, 65375, 13, 364, 3915, 279, 1404, 482, 10035, 11, 433, 1436, 617, 40028, 264, 3148, 52609, 2965, 2999, 480, 7792, 942, 1071, 13, 364, 13461, 3582, 584, 656, 539, 1440, 279, 4839, 4325, 315, 279, 42142, 3686, 11, 584, 656, 1440, 2324, 574, 1633, 28694, 520, 430, 892, 3238, 578, 5536, 10353, 2289, 1555, 279, 9420, 596, 40712, 902, 374, 2212, 220, 966, 16400, 12314, 304, 10913, 8494, 13, 578, 1403, 91858, 1589, 11796, 1051, 3463, 311, 617, 1027, 9057, 994, 264, 42142, 6859, 389, 1202, 5603, 311, 9420, 11, 30164, 1403, 9333, 6305, 1855, 922, 220, 605, 16400, 4028, 13, 1115, 5536, 10353, 11, 422, 11007, 11, 1053, 387, 279, 7928, 304, 279, 1917, 13, 578, 2132, 7928, 374, 279, 650, 265, 755, 371, 75807, 304, 4987, 8494, 11, 56886, 220, 3101, 16400, 13, 1115, 10353, 83417, 389, 279, 7479, 315, 9420, 323, 9093, 374, 8831, 311, 1505, 1109, 1884, 26326, 13, 578, 5536, 10353, 574, 62309, 1306, 7091, 11754, 555, 8798, 323, 7410, 574, 6656, 1139, 9168, 13, 578, 5536, 10353, 574, 62309, 1306, 7091, 11754, 555, 8798, 323, 7410, 11, 52394, 1694, 6656, 1139, 9168, 574, 11352, 11, 1101, 3967, 439, 10988, 88848, 53907, 13, 578, 4519, 315, 420, 88848, 53907, 1501, 430, 3769, 574, 29057, 15338, 704, 315, 279, 3158, 304, 264, 9575, 315, 810, 1109, 220, 1049, 16400, 11, 19392, 279, 13336, 315, 264, 3148, 52609, 13, 4740, 1701, 3980, 91096, 3495, 311, 1427, 520, 279, 5419, 8798, 315, 279, 9578, 323, 72579, 828, 311, 1518, 279, 78352, 315, 279, 9578, 596, 7479, 11, 279, 2128, 315, 3980, 85404, 292, 1705, 6004, 1579, 15798, 68260, 1403, 52957, 26326, 555, 39662, 13, 578, 5536, 10353, 574, 1766, 304, 279, 5111, 11490, 783, 58309, 304, 10913, 8494, 323, 45395, 220, 3443, 52957, 13, 57116, 617, 1027, 1701, 2038, 505, 264, 3682, 220, 679, 15, 18841, 430, 8710, 264, 3544, 42142, 635, 13471, 220, 2287, 3610, 1667, 4227, 49266, 704, 279, 65375, 13, 362, 628, 3972, 315, 24767, 574, 3288, 709, 1139, 279, 3805, 505, 279, 5536, 323, 59132, 505, 420, 19277, 374, 1766, 304, 23902, 2212, 279, 1917, 3432, 13, 4452, 11, 7000, 315, 420, 59132, 706, 1027, 11352, 304, 220, 3101, 3610, 4771, 6418, 10688, 19392, 430, 420, 2816, 1436, 387, 9191, 13, 15903, 7978, 315, 279, 28681, 52755, 323, 18528, 315, 279, 5536, 2816, 527, 304, 5208, 382, 19791, 25], prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

Please output the summary only, without any other text.\n\nArticle:\nThe grandmother of Heather Mack’s newly-born daughter has been having ‘intense discussions’ with the teenager about the future of the baby girl who is destined to spend the first two years of her life behind bars in Bali. Ms Kia Walker has flown from her home near Chicago to stay in the hospital where 19-year-old Miss Mack has given birth to the daughter, whom she has named Stella Schaefer, after her boyfriend Tommy Schaefer. Ms Walker, Mr Schaefer’s mother, is understood to be concerned that the baby girl will remain with Miss Mack in Kerobokan Prison when a court verdict is delivered in the next few weeks. Scroll down for video. New mother: Accused murderer Heather Mack, 19, pictured in her hospital room at\xa0Sanglah Hospital in Denpasar, Indonesia on Wednesday after giving birth to a baby girl. The father is co-accused, Tommy Schaefer. Baby's future: Schaefer's mother Kia Walker was pictured at the hospital on Wednesday, smoking and talking to Mack, and is allegedly pressuring the teen to let her take care of the newborn. Miss Mack and Schaefer have been accused of the premeditated murder of Miss Mack’s socialite mother, Sheila von Wiese-Mack and if they are found guilty they will face many years behind bars - or even the death penalty by firing squad. What happened? Heather Mack and her murdered mother, Sheila von Weise Mack, pictured in an undated vacation photo. Mack is allowed to keep her newborn baby in prison for the first two years. In a desperate attempt to come to an arrangement for her granddaughter’s immediate future, it is understood Ms Walker has been talking in detail to Miss Mack about her intended plans to keep the baby with her in Kerobokan prison for the full two years that babies are allowed to remain there with their mothers. ‘The discussions have been pretty intense,’ said a hospital source. ‘There has been a lot of pressure on Heather to think again about keeping a baby in a prison cell for the first years of her life.’ It has not been revealed whether Ms Walker has offered to look after her grandchild - or whether the same offer has been made from Miss Mack’s relatives. 'There is no doubt she is concerned about the welfare of the baby,' said the source. While Miss Mack recovers from the caesarian delivery in Bali’s Sanglah Hospital on Wednesday, Mr Schaefer’s mother has been seen through a hospital window talking to her at length. Ms Walker has also been observed standing on a hospital balcony, smoking cigarettes. While she has not spoken publicly about her son’s murder case - nor about the birth of his baby - she revealed on social media in October that a plea for donations to help pay for her son’s legal fees had reached $10,600. She said she had been advised not to comment publicly on the murder case in which her son has been accused of battering Mrs Wiese-Mack to death and stuffing her body in a suitcase, with the help of his girlfriend Heather. Accused couple: Heather Mack and Tommy Schaefer, from Chicago, Illinois, (pictured in court on March 12) are being tried for the murder of Mack's mother last August. ‘I spent the weekend practicing self-care,’ she wrote at the time, adding: ‘I’ve accomplished a great deal by staying home and being surrounded by my friends and chosen family.’ But now she is in Bali - and at the bedside of Heather Mack while her son paces up and down his cell in Kerobokan prison, reportedly frustrated because he has been unable to set eyes on his baby daughter. The accused couple are scheduled to appear in court again next week but legal sources suggested the case might be adjourned to allow Miss Mack more time to recover from the birth.\n\nSummary:",

Fuel duty has been frozen for a fifth year in succession, allowing the Chancellor to boast that motorists have had ‘£10 off a tank with the Tories’. Yesterday’s move means a 0.54p-per-litre duty rise planned for September 1 will not go ahead. And the freezing of duty over the five years of the Coalition means the average driver spends £10 less per fill-up than if the controversial ‘fuel-price escalator’ had been implemented in full. Between 2011 and 2016, a typical motorist will have saved £675, the Treasury calculated. The planned fuel duty rise by the RPI rate of inflation on September 2015 would have increased the current duty rate by 0.54p per litre – from the current 57.95p to 58.49p. For an average family car fill-up of 55 litres, this would have increased the cost by 30p. Mr Osborne said he had cancelled the fuel duty rise because ‘I want to help families with the cost of filling up a car’. He added: ‘It’s a cost that bears heavily on small businesses too. It’s the longest duty freeze in over 20 years. It saves a family around £10 every time they fill up their car. That’s £10 off a tank with the Tories.’ Motoring groups welcomed the policy and urged any future government ‘not to step back on the escalator’. The RAC said the above-inflation fuel duty ‘escalator’ that operated between 1993 and 1999 ‘is the primary reason that we now pay nearly 70 per cent in tax on every litre of fuel we buy at the pumps’. AA president Edmund King said: ‘The Coalition has done its “fuel duty” by shielding drivers from some of the impact of volatile fuel prices over the past four years by freezing fuel duty, and we welcome the further freeze and cancellation of the scheduled fuel duty rise for September 2015. ‘With petrol and diesel prices surging and falling by more than 35p a litre since 2010, the continued four-year fuel duty freeze allows the Coalition to dodge the fuel-protest bullet.’ Howard Cox, of the FairFuelUK campaign, welcomed the freeze but said the Chancellor should have gone further and cut duty. The move means a 0.54p-per-litre duty rise planned for September 1 will not go ahead, which for an average family car fill-up of 55 litres, would have increased the cost by 30p. He added: ‘We give Mr Osborne six out of ten for endeavour and will continue to campaign that duty should be frozen for the lifetime of the next Parliament.’ RAC Foundation director Professor Stephen Glaister said: ‘With fuel duty revenue making up about 5 per cent of the Treasury’s tax income there was never going to be a huge giveaway as the Chancellor still desperately needs motorists’ money.’ He added: ‘But with the latest figures showing that almost a million of the poorest households see a quarter of what they spend go on buying and running a car the continued freeze is very welcome.’ Lynsey and Tom Fox, pictured with their two children Megan, 6, and Emily, 1, will save £50 a month on fuel. Lynsey and Tom Fox will save £600 a year thanks to the fuel duty freeze. The couple, who use their cars for commuting and taking six-year-old Megan and one-year-old Emily to school and nursery, drive a combined 1,500 miles a month. Mr Fox, an IT manager, spends two hours a day making his 35-mile commute in rush hour. Filling up his 2.7-litre Mercedes every week costs him £280 a month. Mrs Fox, a maths teacher, spends another £70 a month on fuel for her VW Golf. Yesterday George Osborne delayed an increase in fuel duty once again – meaning drivers are nearly £10 better off every time they fill up their car than they would have been had Labour’s ‘fuel-price escalator’ still been operating. This saves the family, pictured, about £50 a month. Mr Fox said: ‘The extra money we save will be a nice little boost and we can spend more on the kids.’ Company cars take a clobbering. Basil Fawlty attacks his Austin 1100 in show. Starsky and Hutch's 1975 Ford Gran Torino. The classic car to which Basil Fawlty administered ‘a damned good thrashing’ is now exempt from road tax. The character played by Monty Python actor John Cleese famously took a tree branch to a red Austin 1100 estate in frustration after it broke down on him in the 1970s comedy series Fawlty Towers. But now it has reached an age where the Government no longer requires Vehicle Excise Duty to be paid. Also newly exempt is the red 1975 Ford Gran Torino – with its trademark stripe – as used and rolled over by American TV cops Starsky & Hutch, played by actor and singer David Soul and Paul Michael Glaser in the popular 1970s crime- fighting series. Paul Clark, senior tax manager at City accountants Deloitte, said: ‘An exemption from Vehicle Excise Duty for vehicles constructed 40 or more years ago was introduced in April 2014. ‘This exemption applies automatically on a rolling basis on 1 April each year. ‘So next month all cars made before 1 January 1976 will be exempt from the duty.’ He added: ‘This includes the 1975 Ford Gran Torino used in Starsky & Hutch and the Austin 1100 estate famously thrashed by Basil Fawlty in 1975’. The majority of drivers with company cars will be hundreds of pounds worse off after the Chancellor moved to make the work perk ‘greener’. The tax levied on the majority of company cars will be increased by three percentage points in 2019-20. The rate for environmentally-friendly vehicles will also rise – but at a ‘slower rate’. City accountants said the changes are unfair on company car drivers locked into three or four-year deals who chose a cheaper vehicle ‘in good faith’ – only to have it re-classified months later as a gas-guzzler, and taxed accordingly. The Government’s avowed aim of the changing tax rates for the ‘benefit in kind’ is to push company car drivers into greener vehicles – such as fully electric or hybrid cars, which carry a smaller tax burden. This has fuelled a boom in low-tax ‘plug-in’ hybrid vehicles, which can be charged from the mains but also run on conventional fuel. The tax on these so-called ‘ultra-low-emissions vehicles – or ULEVs – is still rising too. However, the Chancellor is at pains to point out that it is rising at a ‘slower’ rate because he is increasing the gap between the tax on the cleanest ‘green’ cars and the conventionally-fuelled alternatives. George Osborne told MPs: ‘To encourage a new generation of low-emission vehicles we will increase their company car tax more slowly than previously planned.’ Ashley Hollinshead of accountants Deloitte stressed that because most company car drivers are signed up to three or four-year deals, they will be penalised for choices made well before the changes were introduced. ‘It’s effectively a retrospective tax on cars,’ he said. ‘Many employees with company cars will be locked into long term deals and will have no choice but to bear the ever-increasing cost of company car tax.’ ‘Having previously introduced an annual two-percentage-point increase in the rate of company car benefit in kind to 2018/19, today George Osborne announced a further annual hike of three percentage points from 2019/20. This announcement will see the benefit in kind rate increase by nearly 50 per cent in the period to 2019/20. ‘For example, the benefit in kind rate on [a car emitting 100 grams of carbon per kilometre] will increase from 19 per cent next tax year to 28 per cent by 2019/20.‘. The changes mean a driver paying the 40p tax rate with a £28,000 1.6-litre Nissan Qashqai provided by their employer will be £1,008 worse off after five years, with a ‘benefit in kind’ tax bill of £3,360. Someone with a Golf GTI worth £28,000 will also see their tax increase by £1,008, to a total of £3,472. An executive with a £38,000 BMW 5 Series will pay £1,368 more, taking their annual bill to £4,712, while anyone with an £81,000 three-litre Range Rover Sport as their company car will be nearly £2,600 worse off, with an annual bill of £11,998. However, taxes on green cars mean the driver of a top-selling £28,304 Mitsubishi Outlander hybrid will also see their company car tax treble – rising by £1,245 to £1,811 a year. Tax on a £32,000 Volkswagen Golf GTE hybrid will rise by £1,408 to £2,028 by 2019-20. Britain will become a world-leader in the development of driverless cars thanks to a £100million boost from the Chancellor. The figure will be matched by private-sector funding for a total pot of £200million. The announcement was welcomed by Jaguar Land Rover, which hailed a policy that will ‘help create the smarter and more connected cars of the future’. Two driverless car pilot schemes are already under way in Greenwich and Bristol. Much of the technology – from automatic parking to radars that scan for pedestrians or cyclists and can slam on the brakes – already exist in the latest cars on the road. However, new research is aimed at making driverless cars both safe and socially acceptable.\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0,

Located 415-417 Collins Street, the retail property was auctioned off in front of a crowd of 200 spectators, while 12 parties vied to call the place their own. The Age\xa0reported that bids on the historic building began at $5 million before moving up the scale to the $8 million mark. In total 51 bids were made by the dozen bidders, but when it came down to the wire only two prospective owners were left in the race. A historic Melbourne property sold for $8.88888 million on Thursday. Located at 415-417 Collins Street the four level building has a bar, cafe, and two levels of office buildings. Both of the final parties were Chinese investors, one based in Melbourne and the other from Shanghai. The local bidder's final amount was\xa0$8.884 million. Following that auctioneer Phillip Kingston called for a higher bid of successive eights, a lucky number according to Chinese tradition. 'Let's just get there. We were always going to get there,' Mr Kingston said, according to The Age. The Sherlock Holmes pub is located in the basement of the pub. The Ry family from Shanghai province are now the owners of the multi-level building. As the number $8.888888 flashed up on an electronic screen next to the auctioneer, the losing family stormed off. The Ry family from Shanghai province are now the owners of the multi-level building, which according to the listing has 'terrific potential for rental growth and an opportunity to part owner-occupy'. CBRE agents Josh Rutman, Mark Wizel and Lewis Tong handled the sale of the four level dwelling, for which the reserve was $6.3 million. The property lies in the heart of Melbourne's CBD among the city's best restaurants, bars, and retail facilities. CBRE agents Josh Rutman, Mark Wizel and Lewis Tong handled the sale. The property is located in the centre of the CBD, close to restaurants and public transport. It has a back entrance via Market Street, and is close to transport. The Sherlock Holmes pub is in the basement of the building, while a cafe is located at ground level. Above that there are two levels of office space, one of which is unoccupied. In 1990 the building was bought for $6.5 million, before it was sold in 1999 to a trio of investors for $2.28 million. The last property to be sold on Collins Street was in 2009, when police had to be called because of the huge crowd which had gathered at the time.\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=128, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=False, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: [128000, 9370, 5730, 553, 279, 2768, 3754, 4652, 304, 220, 4386, 11460, 13, 5321, 2612, 279, 12399, 1193, 11, 2085, 904, 1023, 1495, 382, 17064, 512, 32, 18526, 4857, 304, 27535, 596, 22834, 706, 6216, 311, 264, 1633, 18069, 8620, 30693, 369, 264, 6800, 2860, 315, 400, 23, 13, 12251, 12251, 3610, 13, 42867, 220, 18136, 12, 19561, 29770, 6825, 11, 279, 11040, 3424, 574, 21852, 291, 1022, 304, 4156, 315, 264, 13734, 315, 220, 1049, 70402, 11, 1418, 220, 717, 9875, 348, 1142, 311, 1650, 279, 2035, 872, 1866, 13, 578, 13381, 4194, 76833, 430, 44599, 389, 279, 18526, 4857, 6137, 520, 400, 20, 3610, 1603, 7366, 709, 279, 5569, 311, 279, 400, 23, 3610, 1906, 13, 763, 2860, 220, 3971, 44599, 1051, 1903, 555, 279, 21030, 293, 100229, 11, 719, 994, 433, 3782, 1523, 311, 279, 9244, 1193, 1403, 33547, 7980, 1051, 2163, 304, 279, 7102, 13, 362, 18526, 27535, 3424, 6216, 369, 400, 23, 13, 12251, 2421, 3610, 389, 7950, 13, 42867, 520, 220, 18136, 12, 19561, 29770, 6825, 279, 3116, 2237, 4857, 706, 264, 3703, 11, 42030, 11, 323, 1403, 5990, 315, 5274, 14016, 13, 11995, 315, 279, 1620, 9875, 1051, 8620, 15167, 11, 832, 3196, 304, 27535, 323, 279, 1023, 505, 38147, 13, 578, 2254, 78631, 596, 1620, 3392, 574, 4194, 3, 23, 13, 25962, 3610, 13, 23548, 430, 21852, 35856, 59809, 63569, 2663, 369, 264, 5190, 14435, 315, 50024, 384, 2866, 11, 264, 18069, 1396, 4184, 311, 8620, 14135, 13, 364, 10267, 596, 1120, 636, 1070, 13, 1226, 1051, 2744, 2133, 311, 636, 1070, 2965, 4491, 63569, 1071, 11, 4184, 311, 578, 13381, 13, 578, 61726, 40401, 6814, 374, 7559, 304, 279, 31741, 315, 279, 6814, 13, 578, 26775, 3070, 505, 38147, 17271, 527, 1457, 279, 7980, 315, 279, 7447, 11852, 4857, 13, 1666, 279, 1396, 400, 23, 13, 12251, 12251, 70939, 709, 389, 459, 14683, 4264, 1828, 311, 279, 21852, 35856, 11, 279, 13490, 3070, 86087, 1022, 13, 578, 26775, 3070, 505, 38147, 17271, 527, 1457, 279, 7980, 315, 279, 7447, 11852, 4857, 11, 902, 4184, 311, 279, 15182, 706, 364, 69769, 1104, 4754, 369, 19160, 6650, 323, 459, 6776, 311, 961, 6506, 12, 24719, 88, 4527, 22024, 793, 13307, 18747, 48221, 1543, 11, 4488, 468, 450, 301, 323, 21256, 51491, 18073, 279, 6412, 315, 279, 3116, 2237, 51688, 11, 369, 902, 279, 21137, 574, 400, 21, 13, 18, 3610, 13, 578, 3424, 15812, 304, 279, 4851, 315, 27535, 596, 22834, 4315, 279, 3363, 596, 1888, 15926, 11, 16283, 11, 323, 11040, 13077, 13, 22024, 793, 13307, 18747, 48221, 1543, 11, 4488, 468, 450, 301, 323, 21256, 51491, 18073, 279, 6412, 13, 578, 3424, 374, 7559, 304, 279, 12541, 315, 279, 22834, 11, 3345, 311, 15926, 323, 586, 7710, 13, 1102, 706, 264, 1203, 20396, 4669, 8152, 6825, 11, 323, 374, 3345, 311, 7710, 13, 578, 61726, 40401, 6814, 374, 304, 279, 31741, 315, 279, 4857, 11, 1418, 264, 42030, 374, 7559, 520, 5015, 2237, 13, 44710, 430, 1070, 527, 1403, 5990, 315, 5274, 3634, 11, 832, 315, 902, 374, 653, 41456, 13, 763, 220, 2550, 15, 279, 4857, 574, 11021, 369, 400, 21, 13, 20, 3610, 11, 1603, 433, 574, 6216, 304, 220, 2550, 24, 311, 264, 35062, 315, 15167, 369, 400, 17, 13, 1591, 3610, 13, 578, 1566, 3424, 311, 387, 6216, 389, 29770, 6825, 574, 304, 220, 1049, 24, 11, 994, 4379, 1047, 311, 387, 2663, 1606, 315, 279, 6908, 13734, 902, 1047, 20802, 520, 279, 892, 382, 19791, 25], prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

It could be an image from the hit television series "Mad Men," which documented the ribald world of advertising in 1960s America. Except this is 2015 and "Who squeezes them in Harelbeke?" is the poster strapline for the elite E3 Harelbeke competition in Belgium, accompanied by that gloved cyclist\'s hand poised to pinch a woman\'s bottom. Unlike the wind provocatively lifting up her skirt, the controversial advertisement wasn\'t dreamed up out of thin air. It\'s inspired by previous winner Slovak Peter Sagan, who pinched a podium girl\'s behind at the 2013 Tour de Flanders -- something he later apologized for, saying "I promise to act more respectfully in the future." A week earlier, he was also pictured on the E3 Harelbeke podium, making an ass-grabbing motion towards another flower girl. E3 Harelbeke\'s organizers chose to celebrate his antics in their 2015 campaign, sparking a global debate about sexism in cycling that has raced far beyond the billboard. "Old Boy\'s Club" "A guy grabbing a woman\'s ass is very much indicative of a level of sexual assault," said Kathryn Bertine, former professional cyclist and director of "Half the Road," a documentary about female racers. "This poster makes cycling look very outdated. They\'re relying on a \'good old boys club\' tactic to help them sell a product -- and in this case that product is racing." Judging by E3 Harelebeke\'s provocative standards, the poster could even appear tame compared to previous years. In 2011 organizers opted for a naked woman lying in a field, while the silhouettes of miniature riders traversed her bare backside. More baffling was last year\'s poster featuring a woman straddling three other females curled into the shape of a bike. "Such provocative imagery may have been seen by some in the 1950s and 1960s as a basis for selling products, but marketing communications are a rather more sophisticated and progressive activity than they were 50 years ago," said Simon Chadwick, Professor of Sport Business Strategy and Marketing at Coventry University. "I think E3 Harelbeke are rather out of kilter with the way that most people think today." "A playful nod" Cycling\'s world governing body, the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) has since requested the poster be removed, to which the E3 Harelbeke organisers have agreed -- not that they necessarily see it as offensive themselves. "Personally, no I don\'t think it\'s sexist," Marc Claerhout, E3 Harelebeke manager, told CNN. Could he see why others might find it offensive? "I don\'t know. You have a lot of publicity where you see more than some underwear," he said. "And we didn\'t mean it as sexist." The organization has since withdrawn the poster, releasing an official apology to "anyone who might find it intimidating, discriminatory or sexist." "The organization launched this campaign as a playful nod to the stage incident two years ago in which a rider got ready to squeeze the buttocks of a flower girl," it added. Removing the poster is one thing -- but the UCI missed an opportunity to make an example of a tournament which has used seemingly sexist campaigns for years, said Olympic road race champion, Nicole Cooke. "Telling the race organizers to remove the posters is not much of a deterrent," added the retired cyclist whose autobiography "The Breakaway" highlighted sexism within the sport during her over decade long career. "A whopping fine and canceling the race would have sent out the strong message that there is no place for sexism in cycling. Instead, the race has received huge publicity." Celebrating sexual assault? The poster also glorifies what would be seen as sexual assault in any other workplace, said Laura Bates, founder of the "Everyday Sexism Project." "It contains a direct reference to an incident of sexual assault, which shouldn\'t be treated as something to celebrate and joke about," she added. Similarly, Belgium\'s Institute for the Equality between Men and Women, said the image violated 2007 anti-discrimination legislation and "incited sexual intimidation." It\'s unlikely the same image would have been used in a female tournament. "Not only is the poster sexist -- this race doesn\'t even have a women\'s field," said Bertine, who has long campaigned for a women\'s edition of the Tour de France equal to the men\'s -- a race often seen as the ultimate prize in cycling. "Here we are, fighting these battles to make equality happen. And posters like this are not helping to pave the way for cycling," she said. She sees the problem not with the majority of "supportive" male cyclists, but with the lack of female representation among race directors and promoters. Money talks. Indeed, sponsorship is a big factor is getting a race like the Women\'s Tour de France off the ground, said Alex Russell, one of two females on the board of British Cycling. "A lot of it comes down to whether something has a market value -- and it\'s not necessarily down to gender," she said. "We\'ve introduced a women\'s tour in Britain and we have got financial support for that. But you can\'t just jump to mass spectators and mass broadcasting because these things grow incrementally." Former World Road Race champion Cooke points to the discrepancy in prize money as another big obstacle for women within the sport. "The inspiration for the poster is the 2013 Tour de Flanders, for which male winner Fabian Cancellara received €20,000 ($22,000) for his efforts. In comparison, when I won this event, I was happy for the team to split the modest €1,000 I received amongst the other riders," she said. "The biggest change I would recommend to provide protection, security and credibility for female road riders, would be the introduction of a minimum wage, as there is in place for male riders," added Cooke. "Cycling cannot be allowed to exist outside the laws of society, like some sort of medieval anarchy." It seems that rather than a podium girl\'s bottom, the one being put under the spotlight at this year\'s event, will be the organizers themselves.\n\nSummary:', params: SamplingParams(n=1,

Please output the summary only, without any other text.\n\nArticle:\nThe Green Party is set to unveil its big weapon for the General Election campaign – a sultry, pouting, middle-aged ‘boyband’ comprising David Cameron, Ed Miliband, Nick Clegg and Nigel Farage. The party, which is languishing at six per cent in the polls, is recruiting lookalikes to portray the four main party leaders in a cringe-inducing party political broadcast due to be screened next month. Strangely, the Greens are even hiring an actress to play their own leader, the gaffe-prone Natalie Bennett, and have put out a casting call for suitable candidates. Strategists stipulate that her doppelganger be in her late 30s to mid-40s – although Bennett is 49 –and be ‘like a schoolteacher, life experience under her belt. She must also be ‘the voice of reason, friendly, warm and approachable but has a message to get across’. The full excruciating details of what the Greens believe is ‘a fun, clever and refreshing idea’ is revealed in a leaked casting brief. Fake that: Our mock-up of (left to right) party leaders David Cameron, Nick Clegg, Ed Miliband and Nigel Farage as a boyband. It adds that four male party leaders’ lookalikes ‘should be unnaturally intense, emotional and passionate – like a boyband. Loads of smouldering stares, deep thinking and soulful singing. Thick lashings of powerful slow motion movements and pensive gazes will help intensify the drama. ‘They may be leaders of different parties, but they seem to know the same lyrics to the same song and be in perfect harmony. I like the idea that as the song builds and climaxes, they are literally finishing off each others sentences… That is how ridiculously in harmony they are. ‘Above all, they should all look incredibly pleased with themselves. It will be amusing to have disgruntled reaction shots of the other leaders at the end as the Green Party’s common sense message is delivered.’ On the lookalikes, it adds: ‘It would be great if the leaders were slightly better looking, more buff and hunkier than the actual leaders in real life. Kind of how they see themselves inside their own minds. But this is not a priority. First and foremost they need to register as politicians.’ Less kind critics might suggest that the Greens need to register as politicians themselves. Some of the cringe-inducing lyrics of the Green Party’s song spoof. It’s sweeter when we agree, a party political harmony (Oh baby) Lose your voting inhibitions, join the one true coalition (ohh-ahh-lii-shuuuuun) Let’s frack this green and pleasant land. Come on Eddie, join the band. The public won’t know what to do, if they have to pick from me and you-uuuu. The choice between us couldn’t be clearer. Oxford! Cambridge! Diversity for ya. Whether it’s Trident or High Speed 2, the lesser of four evils is up to you. MoS man: how I gatecrashed world's unfunniest send-up. By Adam Lee-Potter. It is unusual enough to be in the same room as Messrs Cameron, Miliband, Clegg and Farage. But to be in a backstreet Soho studio with 13 versions of them gyrating, pouting and cavorting around was beyond bizarre. Welcome to the casting session for what must go down as the most toe-curlingly awful party political broadcast ever. I secretly infiltrated the Green Party audition under the flimsy guise of being an ersatz David Cameron. It was clear they were desperate. I emailed, just hours before the audition, telling them – truthfully – that Gok Wan once told me I looked like the PM. Don't call us: Our reporter Adam goes to the hideously awkward audition for the Green Party broadcast. Did I say they were desperate? I heard back within minutes – and the woman didn’t ask if I was a professional actor or had an agent. I’m not, clearly! I was told that I would be auditioning for Cameron at 2pm the next day and that the fee – just for turning up – was £250. Super. But the email warned I should be prepared to ‘boyband it up’ – possibly the four most upsetting words I have ever received. At the offices of Die-Cast, all 13 of us were told to learn our lines – which seemed a tad rich of the Green Party when its own leader couldn’t remember hers in a ‘car crash’ interview with London’s LBC radio station. I hurriedly attempted to memorise the lyrics of Take That’s Greatest Day – the mawkish pop video for which we were set to recreate. Then five minutes later, it all changed: we were told to forget that and instead mug up on a ‘It’s sweeter when we all agree’ version. This was rapidly becoming more confusing than a Green Party conference, not least because despite being middle-aged and suited, I don’t look at all like Cameron. But then the other three in ‘my’ boyband looked nothing like their supposed doppelgangers either. ‘Give me some smoulder,’ the director implored. ‘Be as seductive as you can. Give me more.’ I’m 44 years old, for pity’s sake. I did try to smoulder, which is hard enough at the best of times, but painfully embarrassing when you’re told to lip-sync to a tepid backing track. I couldn’t help thinking this was part of the democratic system our forebears died for. That the law requires the nation’s broadcasters to actually screen this rubbish. Chaos loomed when some portly chap – I have no idea whose lookalike he was supposed to be – admitted he didn’t have a suit with him. Desperate: The Greens are even hiring an actress to play their own leader, the gaffe-prone Natalie Bennett (pictured), and have put out a casting call for suitable candidates. The sweet woman in charge duly dispatched him to Marks & Spencer, telling him to take it back for a refund ‘after the gig’. Then the internet went down. Oh, and they couldn’t work out how to play the track. Then it was the volume control. I rang my wife at this point. ‘Is this April Fool’s Day?’ came her reply. Finally, after an anxious, 30-minute delay during which the pros gargled noisily and massaged their vocal cords, and I – um – didn’t, we were on. The brief rehearsal was over and this was the real audition. I was in the first batch of hopefuls, which I took as a promising sign. We were escorted into a small, bright room. Behind the camera were an assortment of trendy types in lumberjack shirts and lots of facial hair. We read out our names and posed for profile shots. We then had to mime along to the song. ‘Try to emote like a real boyband,’ said the director patiently. ‘Really go for it. Use your hands.’ I did try to channel my inner One Direction but I ended up looking like I was having a fit in the deep end of a swimming pool. We carried on prancing about, nonetheless. Then, worryingly, the Clegg double cuddled me – I don’t quite know why – as we moved into the second verse. Truly hideous: Reporter Adam described his efforts as 'David Brent at a teenage disco: excruciating and slightly off' Shakespeare it ain’t, but the Greens clearly hope this song will ram home their point: when there’s little to divide the main party leaders, vote for us instead. Next, we were told to ‘seduce’ the camera, one by one. I pouted, foolishly, and even tried a little growl. One of the crew tittered, not unreasonably, as I awkwardly caressed my chest and even smoothed my eyebrow with a licked finger. Yes, it was truly that hideous. Imagine David Brent at a teenage disco: excruciating and slightly off. Finally, we had to mime to camera as if we were making a political speech. We all flapped the air and did that funny pointy thing with our thumbs that Cameron likes to do. The Miliband lookalike – the only one even remotely like his famous ‘double’ – got especially carried away, letting out an impressive glottal volley of gibberish. Eventually, we were done, much to everybody’s relief. ‘You’ll be hearing from us if you’ve been successful,’ said an assistant. We could say the same of the Green Party. They shouldn’t hold their breath.\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0,

Returning to radio for the first time since she and fellow 2Day FM co-host Michael Christian posed as the Queen and Prince Charles as part of a prank in 2012 to gain information about the Duchess of Cambridge following the birth of Prince George. Jacintha Saldana was the nurse who took the call, taking her life two days later and blaming her decision on the actions of the Australian radio hosts. Scroll down for video. Former Australian radio host Mel Greig has revealed her personal torment over the prank which resulted in the suicide of a nurse in London. Ms Greig, who was unable to return to her role on the air, said that she felt 'the world hated [her]' for what had happened, and spoke candidly about the grief she felt over her actions. 'I was in disgust with myself, I had failed as a human being, to be involved in someone's death is horrific and it affected me greatly,' she told BBC2 Radio listeners. The former radio host listened to a section of the original broadcast that aired in December 2012, in which she and Mr Christian asked after the well-being of Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge, while she was recovering at King Edward Hospital in London. Ms Saldanha, a night shift nurse sister, was in charge of the hospital and transferred the hoax call to the Duchess of Cambridge's bedside nurse. While Ms Greig said that she now understands that 'there is more to mental health...it's not normally an event like that that can trigger someone to commit suicide,' she experienced overwhelming guilt at the time. Ms Greig said she had experienced deep depression for a year, and claimed that the event had changed her life permanently. In February, Ms Greig joined other female Australian media personalities as part of a campaign to raise awareness about the abuse many women receive online, and was subjected to particularly brutal comments, in a video posted on. Jacintha Saldana committed suicide two days after taking the prank call and blamed the radio hosts. Former 2Day FM co-hosts Greig (left) and Michael Christian (right) posed as the Queen and Prince Charles as part of a prank in 2012. Ms Greig said that the incident had changed her forever and that she felt like the 'world hated [her]' 'I've made a noose Mel, and it belongs around your neck. I can't wait to take your last breath,' one tweet read. 'You've killed a mother so it's only fair we kill yours. You'll never sleep again. I'm coming for you and your mum,' another said. A third tweet read: 'An eye for an eye. Kill yourself or I'll kill you and everyone you care about.' Last year, Ms Greig said that she believed the incident would stay with her forever, but that she has done all she can do now that she has personally apologised to her family. 'I don’t know how you completely forgive yourself – someone wrote my name in their suicide note,' she told Sunrise. 'They thought of me before they took their own life and that will stay with me forever but I can move forward from that point I think because I've tried to say sorry.' 'It was really tough but I made that promise to them over a year ago that if they wanted answers I would go to the inquest so I was always going to go,' she said. 'To be able to to look them in the eye and say sorry was incredibly hard but it’s something I felt I needed to do – everyone was very emotionally involved in that room.' Ms Greig now hopes she can try to move on with her life. 'I do have a little bit more closure and I’ve been finding it so hard to move forward and I think a lot of that had a lot to do with not being able to say sorry – just bearing that guilt and that blame,' she said. Ms Greig was part of another batch of female Australian celebrities have stepped in front of the camera to tackle the sort of vile abuse dished out online. Ms Greig leaves court in London last year, after an inquest into the death of\xa0Jacintha Saldanha. 'To know that I have done everything I can – I tried to help – I said sorry – I feel that I've redeemed myself as much as I can and I hope they got the answers to find the closure as well.' When asked how others involved in the prank had been able to put the tragedy behind them, Ms Greig simply replied that people handle situations differently. 'Some people were able to just move on from that – I wasn’t – it deeply affected me for a long time and when you are the face of blame publicly you believe it,' she said. 'As well, knowing Jacintha herself has written my name in that suicide note and blamed me directly – you hold yourself responsible.' Ms Greig spoke of how the incident had taken its toll on her over the past two and a half years. 'It took every bit of strength and every bit of support to get through that but you have a choice you can keep fighting or you can let it just take you over and I wanted to fight - life is so precious,' she said. 'I wanted to try to get better and a part of that was going to the inquest and saying sorry and helping the family out so combined I feel I’ve got everything so I can truly move forward.'\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[],

Cristie Schoen Codd, 38, a season eight finalist on the Food Network Star, and Joseph Codd, 45, were killed in their Leicester, North Carolina, home last Thursday, police have said. The remains were discovered in Buncombe County on Thursday, but officials say they have not been positively identified. Robert Jason Owens, 36, a construction worker who they had hired to work on their home, was booked\xa0on two counts of first-degree murder, the murder of an unborn child, larceny and breaking and entering on Tuesday. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO. Believed dead: Police believe they have found the bodies of celebrity chef Cristie Schoen Codd (left), 38, a season 8 finalist on Food Network Star, and her husband Joseph Codd (right), 45. Linked: Robert Jason Owens, 36, who has been charged with murdering a pregnant Food Network star and her husband, was a key suspect in the disappearance of Zebb Quinn (pictured) 15 years ago, it has emerged. Suspect: Sheriff Van Duncan said Owens (pictured) was a 'primary suspect' in the 2000 disappearance of 18-year-old Quinn, who vanished while he was going to look at a car for sale in Asheville with Owens, then 21. Dr. Sharon Sweede told Ashville's Citizen Times: 'I\xa0did a brief exam of these remains. We don't have positive identifications. We really can't make any other comment. It has emerged that Owens was a 'primary suspect' in the 2000 disappearance of Zebb Quinn, 18, who vanished while he was going to look at a car for sale in Asheville with Owens, then 21. Quinn, who has not been seen since the night of January 2 that year, was captured on surveillance video buying sodas with Owens at a convenience store after he got off work at Walmart at 9pm. The pair then drove away separately. But they were apparently heading to the same destination to look at a Mitsubishi Eclipse for sale that Quinn was interested in buying, police told\xa0Fox Carolina. Owens later told police that a short while later, Quinn flashed his headlights at him and the two pulled over. Quinn then went off to return a page, before returning in a 'frantic' state, Owens said. Cancelling the pair's plans to see the Mitsubishi, Quinn reportedly told Owens he needed to leave and drove off, bumping into his friend's truck on his way. Since that moment, he has been missing. On January 3, Quinn's mother, Denise Vlahakis, filed a missing person's report.\xa0Two weeks later, the alleged victim's car, a 1990 Mazda Protégé, appeared in the parking lot of a nearby restaurant. Bizarrely, a live puppy was inside the vehicle, which was situated at The Little Pigs Barbecue near a hospital where Vlahakis worked. A pair of lips were also drawn on the car's back windshield. Unanswered questions: Quinn (left), who has not been seen since the night of January 2, 2000, was captured on video buying sodas with Owens (right, in his mug shot in the Codds' murder case) at a convenience store after he got off work at Walmart at 9pm. Later that night, the teenager drove off and has not been seen since. Work: Quinn, a Roberson High School graduate, had no extra clothes, money or contact lenses solution with him on the night he vanished. He also enjoyed his work at this Walmart (pictured), his family said at the time. Mother: On January 3, Quinn's mother, Denise Vlahakis (pictured), filed a missing person's report. Two weeks later, the alleged victim's car, a 1990 Mazda Protégé, appeared in the parking lot of a nearby restaurant. Bizarrely, a live puppy was inside the vehicle, while a pair of lips were drawn on the car's back windshield. It remains unknown who the Labrador-mix puppy - which was around three months old - belonged to. It was later adopted by a police officer, according to\xa0The Charley Project\xa0cold cases website. In February, police were\xa0authorized\xa0to take hair, blood and saliva samples from Owens in relation to the\xa0disappearance of Quinn, whom his family said would not have gone away of his own accord. Although they never acquired evidence to warrant charges against Owens,\xa0Sheriff Van Duncan told The Citizen-Times in Asheville Owens 'was definitely a primary suspect in the Zebb Quinn case'. Vlahakis later said of her son: 'We all feel very certain that he was killed that night', explaining how he had no extra clothes, money or contact lenses solution with him on the night he vanished. Speaking to Fox Carolina, the grief-stricken mother added: 'It is hard because we don't know and it's hard because we can't say goodbye and kind of put everything at rest.' Movie set: Mrs Codd (pictured in a Food Network photo) ) was due to cater on a movie set, while her husband was heading off to Los Angeles to work as a key grip on a production when they vanished. It was a very big movie set for Mrs Codd - she had just announced her firm would be providing food on the set of The Big Short. Home: In the Codds' supposed murder case, the couple had hired Owens, who owns a construction company, to do some work at their home (pictured). They were both set to leave for work on Sunday - but never made it. Scene: Authorities (pictured at the scene) believe the Codds were murdered on Thursday by Owens - three days before he reportedly returned to their home and stole a 'laptop computer, jewelry and a Glock handgun' In 2012, Quinn's disappearance was featured on the Investigation Discovery Channel show, \xa0'Disappeared', which covered various theories relating to the baffling cold case. One theory revolved around a woman whom Quinn was apparently romantically interested in. The woman, Misty, reportedly had an abusive boyfriend who had made threats toward the teenager. However, Misty and her partner were questioned by police at the time and no arrests were made. Authorities have said said they believe more than one person may have been involved in Quinn’s disappearance and presumed murder. In the Codds' supposed murder case, the couple had hired Owens, who owns a construction company, to do some work at their home. They were both set to leave for work on Sunday. Mrs Codd was catering on a movie set, while her husband was heading off to Los Angeles to work as a key grip on a production. It was a very big movie set for Mrs Codd, as she had just announced her company, Tree Hugger Catering, would be providing food on the set of The Big Short. The adaptation will star Hollywood actors Brad Pitt, Ryan Gosling, Christian Bale and Steve Carell. However, authorities believe the Codds were murdered on Thursday by Owens - three days before he reportedly returned to their home and stole a 'laptop computer, jewelry and a Glock handgun'. Family members reported the couple missing on Sunday, according to reports. Police have not disclosed whether they have suspicions on how the couple might have been killed. Big names: The adaptation will star Hollywood actors Brad Pitt, Ryan Gosling, Christian Bale and Steve Carell. Mrs Codd, who grew up in Mississippi,was five months' pregnant with their first child at the time. The Codds' cars and two dogs were found at their home. James Fisher, a member of a local band that played the Codds' wedding last September, said the pair were a 'beautiful couple'. Speaking of Mr Codd, the musician told the\xa0Citizen-Times of Mr Codd: 'I know he believed in giving people second chances, and he'd hired people out there who'd been in prison.' It remains unclear what Owens' motive was behind the alleged murder. Buncombe County District Attorney Todd Williams said he has not yet decided if he will ask for the death penalty in the case. Owens, who is being held without bail, appeared in court on Tuesday, where he requested an attorney, ABC News 13 reported. His next hearing is scheduled for April 7.\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0,

The messages, exchanged using the GroupMe app, included threats to maim and 'kill' their freshmen teammates and 'take down the coaches.' Mackenzie Reese, 19, Alyssa Semones, 21, Amber Kovalick, 19, Meghan Milani, 19, and Brittany Marquess, 20 have been suspended, with no timetable for their return. The suspended University of Maryland Baltimore County students, including\xa0Alyssa Semones, right, are accused of\xa0threatening freshman teammates in text messages. The Baltimore Post-Examiner received an anonymous email on Friday that contained 16 pages of text screenshots capturing the alleged messages that appeared under the heading 'Sophmores rule.' The messages weren't sent to the freshmen, but exchanged between the senior girls who expressed their hatred for their new teammates. In one text, a player asked if she can just threaten the freshmen and not haze them. That triggered the response from another player, 'Can we just kill them?' To which another replied, 'I'll pitch in.' 'We wanted to make sure you were aware of the extreme situation at UMBC concerning the women's lacrosse team,' the email signed by 'Seeking Justice' said. 'It is an appalling situation of a jealous older group threatening and carrying out threats of harm against the freshman class.' The players, including Meghan Milani, left, and Mackenzie Reese, right, were suspended nearly an hour before last Wednesday's game but were allowed to sit in the bleachers, where they applauded as their freshman teammates were knocked to the ground. There is no timetable for the return of the suspended girls who include Amber Kovalick, left, and Brittany Marquess, right. UMBC athletic director Tim Hall did not discuss specifics of the texts in an interview on Monday, but he said the school has taken steps to protect the team's freshmen. The university did not directly attribute the suspensions to these accusations, saying only that the five players were suspended 'for violation of team rules.' 'The athletic director and other university leaders are following all applicable policies and practices as we work to fully understand the situation and support our student athletes,' the statement said. The players were suspended nearly an hour before their Wednesday game against Drexel but were allowed to sit in the bleachers, where parents said they applauded as their freshman teammates were knocked to the ground. One of the co-head coaches, Tony Giro, refused to attend the Drexel game unless the administration removed the players accused of threatening the freshmen from the team. Co-head coach Amy Appelt coached the players. The players have already missed two games - last Wednesday against Drexel and Saturday against Manhattan. The Retrievers won both games and are 5-3 this season.\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=128, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=False, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: [128000, 9370, 5730, 553, 279, 2768, 3754, 4652, 304, 220, 4386, 11460, 13, 5321, 2612, 279, 12399, 1193, 11, 2085, 904, 1023, 1495, 382, 17064, 512, 38120, 3278, 596, 44979, 53456, 4311, 520, 279, 3907, 315, 23481, 24899, 6406, 617, 1027, 22340, 56334, 1306, 1694, 13487, 315, 27903, 41317, 32746, 304, 1495, 6743, 13, 578, 6743, 11, 48501, 1701, 279, 5856, 7979, 917, 11, 5343, 18208, 311, 296, 2706, 323, 364, 11088, 6, 872, 98849, 32746, 323, 364, 23609, 1523, 279, 24909, 3238, 33491, 57963, 82639, 11, 220, 777, 11, 69410, 53207, 14582, 3233, 11, 220, 1691, 11, 47764, 735, 13825, 875, 11, 220, 777, 11, 80134, 10357, 5676, 11, 220, 777, 11, 323, 89254, 2947, 447, 434, 11, 220, 508, 617, 1027, 22340, 11, 449, 912, 67640, 369, 872, 471, 13, 578, 22340, 3907, 315, 23481, 24899, 6406, 4236, 11, 2737, 118586, 398, 53207, 14582, 3233, 11, 1314, 11, 527, 13487, 315, 4194, 97229, 6147, 41317, 32746, 304, 1495, 6743, 13, 578, 24899, 3962, 12, 849, 65253, 4036, 459, 22939, 2613, 389, 6740, 430, 13282, 220, 845, 6959, 315, 1495, 49820, 40880, 279, 10711, 6743, 430, 9922, 1234, 279, 14836, 364, 86332, 76, 4692, 6037, 3238, 578, 6743, 15058, 956, 3288, 311, 279, 98849, 11, 719, 48501, 1990, 279, 10195, 7724, 889, 13605, 872, 35242, 369, 872, 502, 32746, 13, 763, 832, 1495, 11, 264, 2851, 4691, 422, 1364, 649, 1120, 40250, 279, 98849, 323, 539, 90409, 1124, 13, 3011, 22900, 279, 2077, 505, 2500, 2851, 11, 364, 6854, 584, 1120, 5622, 1124, 20837, 2057, 902, 2500, 20592, 11, 364, 40, 3358, 9846, 304, 3238, 364, 1687, 4934, 311, 1304, 2771, 499, 1051, 8010, 315, 279, 14560, 6671, 520, 58222, 5002, 18815, 279, 3278, 596, 44979, 53456, 2128, 2965, 279, 2613, 8667, 555, 364, 40450, 287, 12007, 6, 1071, 13, 364, 2181, 374, 459, 85905, 6671, 315, 264, 41690, 9191, 1912, 27903, 323, 15691, 704, 18208, 315, 11682, 2403, 279, 41317, 538, 3238, 578, 4311, 11, 2737, 80134, 10357, 5676, 11, 2163, 11, 323, 33491, 57963, 82639, 11, 1314, 11, 1051, 22340, 7154, 459, 6596, 1603, 1566, 8079, 596, 1847, 719, 1051, 5535, 311, 2503, 304, 279, 12704, 27618, 11, 1405, 814, 96728, 439, 872, 41317, 32746, 1051, 33085, 311, 279, 5015, 13, 2684, 374, 912, 67640, 369, 279, 471, 315, 279, 22340, 7724, 889, 2997, 47764, 735, 13825, 875, 11, 2163, 11, 323, 89254, 2947, 447, 434, 11, 1314, 13, 58222, 5002, 29703, 7690, 9538, 11166, 1550, 539, 4358, 49449, 315, 279, 22755, 304, 459, 7274, 389, 7159, 11, 719, 568, 1071, 279, 2978, 706, 4529, 7504, 311, 6144, 279, 2128, 596, 98849, 13, 578, 12374, 1550, 539, 6089, 7180, 279, 9482, 4769, 311, 1521, 36569, 11, 5605, 1193, 430, 279, 4330, 4311, 1051, 22340, 364, 2000, 20535, 315, 2128, 5718, 3238, 364, 791, 29703, 7690, 323, 1023, 12374, 6164, 527, 2768, 682, 8581, 10396, 323, 12659, 439, 584, 990, 311, 7373, 3619, 279, 6671, 323, 1862, 1057, 5575, 23579, 2965, 279, 5224, 1071, 13, 578, 4311, 1051, 22340, 7154, 459, 6596, 1603, 872, 8079, 1847, 2403, 423, 38639, 301, 719, 1051, 5535, 311, 2503, 304, 279, 12704, 27618, 11, 1405, 6699, 1071, 814, 96728, 439, 872, 41317, 32746, 1051, 33085, 311, 279, 5015, 13, 3861, 315, 279, 1080, 27488, 24909, 11, 19036, 480, 8869, 11, 16436, 311, 9604, 279, 423, 38639, 301, 1847, 7389, 279, 8735, 7108, 279, 4311, 13487, 315, 27903, 279, 98849, 505, 279, 2128, 13, 3623, 27488, 7395, 29793, 1883, 3903, 71022, 279, 4311, 13, 578, 4311, 617, 2736, 13942, 1403, 3953, 482, 1566, 8079, 2403, 423, 38639, 301, 323, 7884, 2403, 29890, 13, 578, 20035, 3078, 2834, 2225, 3953, 323, 527, 220, 20, 12, 18, 420, 3280, 382, 19791, 25], prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

Officials were left red-faced after Germany's foreign minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier received the gift from Romania's  Bogdan Aurescu at the end of a news conference marking 135 years of diplomatic relations. But what was immediately apparent was that the map on the brochure, filled with the colors of the German flag, was that of France, not Germany. German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier and his Romanian counterpart Bogdan Aurescu exchange the gift unaware it shows a map of France filled with the colors of the German flag. Mr Steinmeier unwittingly holds the brochure aloft after it was given to him by the Romanian government. Pictures show the two ministers grinning and posing for photos as Mr Steinmeier receives the gift unaware the obvious error is being displayed to the world. Today the foreign ministry said it had fired spokeswoman Brandusa Predescu, saying the incident 'projected a totally unfavorable image.' Romania also said Mr Steinmeier had responded diplomatically, claiming he hadn't noticed the mistake. Immediately following the mix-up, Romania's Foreign Ministry apologized, saying it had received the brochure in the morning containing the error from national news agency Agerpres. Its statement read: 'Due to a regrettable technical error, exclusively on the cover of the booklet, the border of the maps of Romania and France - with the latter being covered by the German flag - was printed. 'The Romanian foreign minister has directly conveyed profound regret for this situation to his German counterpart.' New agency Agerpres later apologized to both the German and Romanian foreign ministries for the mix-up, as did the printing company. It is the second time in just over a month that Romania's foreign ministry has had to apologise for a mistake. In February the Romanian embassy in Paris sent out invitations for a reception and accidentally attached a spreadsheet with unflattering descriptions of guests such as 'undesirable' or 'ghastly'.\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=128, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=False, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: [128000, 9370, 5730, 553, 279, 2768, 3754, 4652, 304, 220, 4386, 11460, 13, 5321, 2612, 279, 12399, 1193, 11, 2085, 904, 1023, 1495, 382, 17064, 512, 32, 293, 2234, 2785, 74697, 3109, 78234, 706, 1027, 77561, 1306, 264, 13015, 77634, 23415, 264, 8352, 311, 813, 6063, 45116, 4194, 4291, 264, 2472, 315, 9822, 11, 539, 10057, 11, 1672, 17890, 389, 433, 13, 64239, 1051, 2163, 2579, 77981, 1306, 10057, 596, 7362, 13015, 9454, 13299, 38377, 35606, 2727, 1291, 4036, 279, 8352, 505, 47149, 596, 220, 42648, 36255, 362, 1439, 20811, 520, 279, 842, 315, 264, 3754, 10017, 36024, 220, 8878, 1667, 315, 34616, 4398, 13, 2030, 1148, 574, 7214, 10186, 574, 430, 279, 2472, 389, 279, 79903, 11, 10409, 449, 279, 8146, 315, 279, 6063, 5292, 11, 574, 430, 315, 9822, 11, 539, 10057, 13, 6063, 19620, 9675, 9454, 13299, 38377, 35606, 2727, 1291, 323, 813, 74697, 45116, 42648, 36255, 362, 1439, 20811, 9473, 279, 8352, 41747, 433, 5039, 264, 2472, 315, 9822, 10409, 449, 279, 8146, 315, 279, 6063, 5292, 13, 4491, 35606, 2727, 1291, 95119, 398, 10187, 279, 79903, 54266, 728, 1306, 433, 574, 2728, 311, 1461, 555, 279, 74697, 3109, 13, 29485, 1501, 279, 1403, 35050, 1099, 20353, 323, 53004, 369, 7397, 439, 4491, 35606, 2727, 1291, 21879, 279, 8352, 41747, 279, 8196, 1493, 374, 1694, 12882, 311, 279, 1917, 13, 11450, 279, 7362, 25887, 1071, 433, 1047, 14219, 34241, 16835, 31853, 30924, 3380, 84, 11, 5605, 279, 10672, 364, 5094, 291, 264, 12756, 93071, 2217, 3238, 47149, 1101, 1071, 4491, 35606, 2727, 1291, 1047, 16846, 30621, 7167, 11, 21039, 568, 19117, 956, 14000, 279, 16930, 13, 69352, 2768, 279, 6651, 5352, 11, 47149, 596, 19620, 20214, 58077, 11, 5605, 433, 1047, 4036, 279, 79903, 304, 279, 6693, 8649, 279, 1493, 505, 5426, 3754, 9266, 362, 1414, 24544, 13, 11699, 5224, 1373, 25, 364, 34160, 311, 264, 23023, 2048, 11156, 1493, 11, 24121, 389, 279, 3504, 315, 279, 74343, 11, 279, 3973, 315, 279, 14370, 315, 47149, 323, 9822, 482, 449, 279, 15629, 1694, 9960, 555, 279, 6063, 5292, 482, 574, 17124, 13, 364, 791, 74697, 7362, 13015, 706, 6089, 73897, 28254, 23023, 369, 420, 6671, 311, 813, 6063, 45116, 3238, 1561, 9266, 362, 1414, 24544, 3010, 58077, 311, 2225, 279, 6063, 323, 74697, 7362, 90124, 369, 279, 6651, 5352, 11, 439, 1550, 279, 18991, 2883, 13, 1102, 374, 279, 2132, 892, 304, 1120, 927, 264, 2305, 430, 47149, 596, 7362, 25887, 706, 1047, 311, 82485, 369, 264, 16930, 13, 763, 7552, 279, 74697, 46567, 304, 12366, 3288, 704, 59769, 369, 264, 23991, 323, 33484, 12673, 264, 46986, 449, 653, 1517, 31436, 28887, 315, 15051, 1778, 439, 364, 1263, 288, 26014, 6, 477, 364, 876, 561, 398, 30736, 19791, 25], prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

In an interview with Billboard\xa0magazine, she said that finding out about the 23-year-old star's death encouraged her to leave the chorus behind and try out as a solo pop artist in New York. Touching on her career choice, the 45-year-old continued: 'It made me realize... Life is short, and you don't know what's going to happen. Go for your dreams and don't let anyone hold you back.' Selena - nicknamed the 'Mexican Madonna' for her provocative dress sense - was shot and killed by Yolanda Saldívar, the president of her fan club on March 31, 1995 in Corpus Christi, Texas.

Tomorrow marks the 20th anniversary of her death, for which\xa0Saldívar is serving life for. Lopez, who actually went on to play Selena in a 1997 biopic, added that the young artist was'special' and'moved the world in a different way.' She continued: 'That's why we're still talking about her 20 years later.... People like that don't come along every day. 'There is never going to be another Selena.' Just two years after playing Selena,\xa0Lopez successfully managed to convert herself from a film star to a pop star. Flashback: Selena photographed performing for the crowd during a dance following the Feria de las Flores queen's contest at Memorial Coliseum August 12, 1989, in Corpus Christi, Texas. Making an impression: Lopez, who actually went on to play Selena in a 1997 biopic (seen above), added that the young artist was'special' and'moved the world in a different way' Selena began performing as a child, singing in Los Dinos, a band formed by her father that featured her brother A.B. on bass and sister Suzette on drums. She went on to win a Best Mexican-American Album Grammy for Live, had several hits in the U.S. and was about to cross over to the English-language pop market when she was murdered weeks before her 24th birthday. Her posthumous album, Dreaming of You, which was mostly recorded in English, topped the Billboard 200 chart and stayed atop the Latin charts for nine months. In recognition of Selena's passing two decades ago, the Latin world will remember her with concerts, lookalike contests, dances and a massive festival. Mourning her loss: The parents of deceased Tejano singer Selena, Marcella and Abraham Quintanilla Jr. (R), seen at a press conference in Beverly Hills to mark the announcement of her biopic. Behind bars: Yolanda Saldívar (right) is serving a life sentence for the 1995 murder of Selena (left) On April 17 and 18, two days after her birthday, Selena's family are set to throw the inaugural Fiesta de la Flor in her hometown,  to celebrate her legacy. The festival will feature performances from Los Lobos and other Tejano stars as well as a screening of Selena, starring Jennifer Lopez in her breakout role. The two main Spanish-language TV networks in the U.S. will also air special Selena programming over the weekend. The late singer's father, A.B. Quintanilla, insists Selena's music has not dated, citing the hit 'Tecnocumbia.' 'If you play a Selena cumbia and compare it with any other record from today, it sounds as if it had been recorded yesterday,' he said. 'We remember our daughter every single day.'\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0,

Visiting an art gallery yesterday, the Duchess of Cambridge had on the same Dalmatian-print coat she wore while pregnant with Prince George. Kate, whose second child is due in six weeks, accessorised with Stuart Weitzman suede pumps, a Mulberry clutch bag and Annoushka earrings. Scroll down for video. Deja vu: Kate was snapped in the same coat yesterday (left) that she wore during pregnancy No1, right. Body of work: The Duchess of Cambridge peers at an eerily realistic 'corpse' lying on the gallery floor. She was last seen wearing the £169 coat from high street label Hobbs at a ship’s naming ceremony in 2013. Yesterday’s visit took a macabre twist when Kate was confronted with a ‘dead body’ lying on the gallery floor. ‘Oh my goodness, what’s that?’ said the duchess as she peered at the eerily realistic bodycast made of silicone by artist Jeremy Millar. Titled ‘Self Portrait as a Drowned Man’, it is so lifelike visiting parents have been warned to make sure their children realise it is not the real thing. But Kate took it in her stride during her visit to the Turner Contemporary gallery in Margate, Kent. The 33-year-old, who has a 2:1 history of art degree from St Andrews, looked delighted to be indulging her arty side. Art fan: The Duchess looked animated as she spoke to  artist, Gavin Turk, about his work (pictured right) Contemporary: Artist John Davies chats to Kate about his sculpture Scarecrow during her tour of the gallery. Relaxed: The royal spoke to artist Trish Morrissey about her photograph entitled Hayley Coles June 17th 2006. She chatted to artist Gavin Turk, although she seemed more interested in his beard, explaining that her brother James has been growing facial hair of his own. Mr Turk said afterwards: ‘She immediately asked me about my beard. She said she was a bit concerned as her brother was growing one.’ Kate also admitted that she sometimes finds it hard to remember she is expecting. Artist Jenny Cranstone, who chatted with her, revealed: ‘I said, “You’re looking very trim.” She said, “I sometimes forget I’m pregnant”.’ Getting creative: The Duchess chats to a pupil from the Holy Trinity and St. John's Primary School in Margate. Mucking in: Kate took part in an art class with a group of budding artists from the primary school. Striking: Student Axelle Van Wynsberghe showed the Duchess a piece she was working on.\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=128, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=False, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: [128000, 9370, 5730, 553, 279, 2768, 3754, 4652, 304, 220, 4386, 11460, 13, 5321, 2612, 279, 12399, 1193, 11, 2085, 904, 1023, 1495, 382, 17064, 512, 8100, 596, 3967, 369, 34978, 1077, 48374, 13, 1628, 420, 892, 11, 279, 38723, 574, 4228, 311, 7858, 13, 7811, 5977, 459, 1989, 18537, 13985, 11, 279, 96039, 315, 24562, 1047, 389, 279, 1890, 423, 7828, 266, 1122, 43245, 23724, 1364, 28670, 1418, 20895, 449, 19912, 10058, 13, 30301, 11, 6832, 2132, 1716, 374, 4245, 304, 4848, 5672, 11, 45484, 4147, 449, 44632, 1226, 11289, 1543, 97735, 43875, 11, 264, 30451, 15717, 43789, 9145, 323, 9489, 788, 71, 4657, 67301, 13, 23198, 1523, 369, 2835, 13, 1611, 5697, 33614, 25, 30301, 574, 48110, 304, 279, 1890, 23724, 13985, 320, 2414, 8, 430, 1364, 28670, 2391, 20209, 2360, 16, 11, 1314, 13, 14285, 315, 990, 25, 578, 96039, 315, 24562, 26081, 520, 459, 44372, 1570, 26569, 364, 81827, 325, 6, 21078, 389, 279, 18537, 6558, 13, 3005, 574, 1566, 3970, 12512, 279, 7083, 11739, 23724, 505, 1579, 8761, 2440, 37876, 1302, 520, 264, 8448, 753, 36048, 22260, 304, 220, 679, 18, 13, 61133, 753, 4034, 3952, 264, 9155, 370, 265, 27744, 994, 30301, 574, 41782, 449, 264, 3451, 34854, 2547, 529, 21078, 389, 279, 18537, 6558, 13, 3451, 12174, 856, 39526, 11, 1148, 753, 430, 45258, 1071, 279, 294, 1412, 434, 439, 1364, 1069, 12616, 520, 279, 44372, 1570, 26569, 2547, 3914, 1903, 315, 54025, 555, 10255, 28217, 8384, 277, 13, 350, 15621, 3451, 12363, 79682, 439, 264, 423, 45184, 2418, 20182, 433, 374, 779, 10345, 301, 3043, 17136, 6699, 617, 1027, 19201, 311, 1304, 2771, 872, 2911, 39256, 433, 374, 539, 279, 1972, 3245, 13, 2030, 30301, 3952, 433, 304, 1077, 19782, 2391, 1077, 4034, 311, 279, 34131, 48302, 18537, 304, 24079, 349, 11, 18206, 13, 578, 220, 1644, 4771, 6418, 11, 889, 706, 264, 220, 17, 25, 16, 3925, 315, 1989, 8547, 505, 800, 52951, 11, 7111, 35072, 311, 387, 37960, 3252, 1077, 802, 1919, 3185, 13, 5277, 8571, 25, 578, 96039, 7111, 11625, 439, 1364, 12570, 311, 220, 10255, 11, 64495, 21187, 11, 922, 813, 990, 320, 69389, 1314, 8, 48302, 25, 29459, 3842, 56872, 49626, 311, 30301, 922, 813, 51067, 2522, 548, 52905, 2391, 1077, 7364, 315, 279, 18537, 13, 6649, 52551, 25, 578, 30336, 12570, 311, 10255, 1183, 819, 30283, 8674, 922, 1077, 10512, 20458, 18276, 3258, 3623, 645, 5651, 220, 1114, 339, 220, 1049, 21, 13, 3005, 523, 12400, 311, 10255, 64495, 21187, 11, 8051, 1364, 9508, 810, 8173, 304, 813, 48788, 11, 26073, 430, 1077, 10868, 7957, 706, 1027, 7982, 28900, 7013, 315, 813, 1866, 13, 4491, 21187, 1071, 27905, 25, 3451, 8100, 7214, 4691, 757, 922, 856, 48788, 13, 3005, 1071, 1364, 574, 264, 2766, 11920, 439, 1077, 10868, 574, 7982, 832, 14639, 30301, 1101, 16584, 430, 1364, 7170, 14035, 433, 2653, 311, 6227, 1364, 374, 23132, 13, 29459, 52179, 67530, 11046, 11, 889, 523, 12400, 449, 1077, 11, 10675, 25, 3451, 40, 1071, 11, 1054, 2675, 3207, 3411, 1633, 11259, 2029, 3005, 1071, 11, 1054, 40, 7170, 10894, 358, 4344, 20895, 11453, 529, 25531, 11782, 25, 578, 96039, 49626, 311, 264, 61072, 505, 279, 19229, 45659, 323, 800, 13, 3842, 596, 26150, 6150, 304, 24079, 349, 13, 386, 47270, 304, 25, 30301, 3952, 961, 304, 459, 1989, 538, 449, 264, 1912, 315, 86733, 13820, 505, 279, 6156, 2978, 13, 4610, 19787, 25, 11988, 26232, 6853, 13000, 77185, 82, 7881, 383, 8710, 279, 96039, 264, 6710, 1364, 574, 3318, 389, 382, 19791, 25], prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

Please output the summary only, without any other text.\n\nArticle:\n(CNN)The beauty of Afghanistan -- a country blemished by wars, upheaval and the inhumane treatment of women by extremists -- has almost been forgotten by the world, and by many Afghans themselves. In the last few decades, little attention has been paid to the other Afghanistan: the sweet melodies, the kind people, and the beautiful land full of ancient wisdom and intersecting traditions. This is understandable. It would be irresponsible to solely focus on those positives while families are torn apart and the noise of war rings in people\'s ears. Generations of Afghans have had their homes surrounded by battles and their lives punctuated by fear. Afghanistan has been the largest refugee-producing country for 32 years. One out of every four refugees worldwide is Afghan, according to the United Nations. Recently, I was watching an engrossing reality TV show featuring singers when a friend peered over my shoulder and asked about the program. I explained that it was "Afghan Star," Afghanistan\'s answer to "American Idol." She was shocked by the set and the sophisticated arena stage where the stars were standing. That stage could easily have been in New York, Los Angeles, London or Rome. This, I realized, is the Afghanistan no one believes exists, or has ever existed. Afghanistan has a rich tradition of music, poetry, and songs that have influenced its neighbors and any region of the world exposed to the Silk Road. After all, the famous Sufi poet Mawlana Jalalideen Rumi was from modern-day Afghanistan. I grew up across the river in Tajikistan, hearing Afghan songs and tales of the parties in Kabul, and learning about Afghan singers, who are beloved across the region. I started watching "Afghan Star" last year after hearing about contestant Dawood Pazhman from Afghanistan\'s remote northeastern province of Badakhshan, who traveled 16 hours (sometime on foot) to Kabul to audition for the show. This year, another contestant, Panj Shanbe Maftoon, also traveled from that remote region for a chance to audition. Panj Shanbe told TOLO TV, which produces "Afghan Star," that he did not have enough to eat and didn\'t have money for his commute to Kabul. But he knew, he said, that in this day and age, in his new Afghanistan, he can hope, dream, and make things happen. Panj Shanbe\'s story was so compelling, I have tuned in every week for months now to see what he will sing and whether he will be safe from elimination. He is now among the top three contestants. As I watched every show, the beacon of hope of a new Afghanistan became clear to me. Young men and women auditioned, speaking of peace and coexistence, supporting one another outside of tribes or ethnic lines. They wanted what my own children want -- the freedom to explore being a young adult and to follow their dreams. This is the new Afghanistan -- the struggles around poverty, religion and resilience are ever-present, but hope shines through in ways that make everyday life brighter. "Afghan Star" is a source of pride, happiness and escape for many Afghans. When you talk to any Afghan around the world, they know all about the contestants and the judges. They openly give their opinions and feel that they are a part of the process; anyone around the world can vote via SMS and call-ins. The panel of judges acts as an amplifier for the voices of the vulnerable, bringing attention to orphans, poverty, and the plight of women. This grounded attitude is meaningful because each one of the judges is a living legend in Afghanistan -- superstars who also have their own war stories to tell. The stalwart female judge, Shahla Zaland, comes from a family of famous composers and singers. Last year told the contestants a heart-wrenching story about her father\'s life abroad as a refugee and how she believes her father "died of homesickness." Her presence on the panel of judges is a reminder that women are strong, women do not need to be veiled, and that female contestants who audition should be championed. There is a beacon of hope in just looking at how much the show has changed in its 10 seasons. During the first season, after years of the Taliban\'s ban on music, a female contestant performed without a hijab, resulting in death threats. The young woman had to go into hiding. This season, for International Women\'s Day, the show celebrated Afghan women. Male contestants dedicated songs and presented flowers to the women, singing of the strength of Afghan mothers. A young woman performed, dancing with her hair flowing freely. The show ended with a dedication to Afghani poetess Nadia Anjuman. Anjuman studied literature in secret during the Taliban occupation, becoming a well-known published poet before her husband killed her at age 25. He found her writings inappropriate and a stain on his honor. The beautiful irony is that Anjuman\'s words live on in books and songs today. Shahla Zaland performed a song that put Anjuman\'s poetry to music. Wearing an Afghan flag around her shoulders, her hair uncovered, she brought Anjuman\'s words to life:. "I am not that weak willow tree that trembles with the wind. "I am an Afghan woman and so I wail." With three contestants left, the show will end Friday night, appropriately on Nawruz, the Perisan New Year celebrated in Afghanistan, Tajikistan and Iran. Though Panj Shanbe was my initial reason for watching the show, I will be happy no matter which contestant becomes the "Afghan Star." The reality is we are all winners because of one TV program. Those living as refugees and those living abroad by choice, away from the homeland, get a taste of the music and culture of their birth country, sparking renewed belief in the new Afghanistan. And people in Afghanistan are given glimpses of what the new Afghanistan can look like -- a vision of young men and women free from war, who can pursue their dreams.\n\nSummary:', params:

Please output the summary only, without any other text.\n\nArticle:\nReal Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti has stars in his eyes on the front page of Marca on Saturday in the form of Lionel Messi and Diego Simeone. The Spanish paper says ‘Look what’s coming!’ in their headline as they outline two major challenges ahead for the Real manager. ‘The height of rivalry: Ancelotti’s Madrid play for La Liga and the Champions League inside a month against Messi’s Barca and Cholo’s Atletico.’ Marca's front page on Saturday shows Lionel Messi (left) and Diego Simeone (right) in Carlo Ancelotti's eyes. Ancelotti's job is believed to be under pressure and the high-profile fixtures he faces could decide his future. It’s as tough as it gets in Spain as they face a rampant Barcelona on Sunday as they look to peg back the point they trail their great rivals by before next month’s clash with Atletico Madrid in the Champions League quarter finals. AS also focus on the European tie of the round between last year's finalists, looking at Real's determination to make up for their poor record against Atleti this season while the underdogs seek redemption from last year's final. Real have yet to win a game against Atletico this season despite playing them six times, with the most recent result being a 4-0 triumph for their city rivals. AS talks revenge for Atletico Madrid and Real Madrid in the Champions League while Mundo Deportivo looks at Barcelona's two 'Clasicos' - against Real on Sunday and their Champions League tie with PSG. Real Madrid's Institutional Relations Director Emilio Butragueno (L) shakes hands with Atletico Madrid's General Manager Clemente Villaverde at the Champions League draw after the clubs were paired together. Mundo Deportivo, as expected, take a Barcelona focus as they preview Barca's Champions League showdown with Paris Saint-Germain and Sunday's El Clasico. They also touch on how  Barca and Athletic Bilbao have formally asked for the Bernabeu as the venue for the Copa del Rey final. In Italy, almost every major club - bar Juventus - seem to be in some sort of crisis, if you believe their front pages. While La Gazzetta dello Sport looks forward to Juve's favourable draw against Monaco in the Champions League quarter-finals with the headline: 'Juve Grand Prix', Corriere dello Sport focus on how AC Milan will be 'left on its own' ahead of a planned fan walkout against Cagliari at the San Siro. Almost every Italian club other than Juventus looks to be in trouble according to the front pages there.

Please output the summary only, without any other text.\n\nArticle:\nThe relatives of those killed when Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was downed over eastern Ukraine visited a Dutch air base Tuesday to view the wreckage of the plane. For almost all of them, it was the first chance to see the twisted and charred wreckage that lay for months in the fields of war-torn eastern Ukraine after the plane plunged to the ground July 17, most likely after being hit by a missile. All 298 passengers and crew on board the flight from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur were killed. The wreckage was brought back to the Netherlands, where civil and criminal investigations are underway to establish the cause of the disaster and attempt to prosecute those responsible. Scroll down for video. Journalists take images of parts of the wreckage of the Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 displayed in a hangar at Gilze Rijen airbase, Netherlands. Friends and family of the victims of the MH17 plane take pictures of the wreckage, laid out in front of them. Media and relatives look at a jumble of twisted wreckage from behind a rope. The display included charred remains of the Boeing aircraft's jet engines. Dutch military police stands next to parts of the wreckage. The plane was brought down over conflict-torn eastern Ukraine on July 17. Dutch investigators are still probing the cause of the crash that killed all 298 people on board. National Prosecutor's Office spokesman Wim de Bruin said the criminal investigation is 'of an unprecedented scale' and will take at least this year to complete. Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 takes off at 12.31 PM from Schiphol airport near Amsterdam, the Netherlands, on July 17, \xa02014. Family members who viewed the wreckage at the Gilze-Rijen military air base in the southern Netherlands didn't speak to the media Tuesday. More family members were to visit later this week, some 500 people in all. The wreckage, spread across three hangars, included wings, wheels, parts of the fuselage and overhead luggage bins. Some of it was scorched black by fire, while some pieces of the plane's thin metal body were scratched, twisted and torn. Not visible to the media were parts of the plane that investigators said last year appeared 'to indicate that the aircraft was penetrated by a large number of high-energy objects from outside the aircraft'. Experts will soon begin piecing together parts of the plane to help investigators assess the damage and definitively establish the cause, said Sara Vernooij, a spokeswoman for the Dutch Safety Board, which is leading the civilian probe. She said the board's final report is expected 'after the summer.' Not visible to the media were parts of the plane that investigators said last year appeared 'to indicate that the aircraft was penetrated by a large number of high-energy objects from outside the aircraft' A note reading 'NG part IR unknown' is attached to a piece of metal amidst parts of the wreckage. Experts will soon begin piecing together parts of the plane to help investigators assess the damage and definitively establish the cause of the crash. National Prosecutor's Office spokesman Wim de Bruin said the criminal investigation is 'of an unprecedented scale' and will take at least this year to complete. Silene Fredriksz-Hoogzand, whose son, Bryce, and his girlfriend, Daisy Oehlers, were on board the stricken flight, will visit the wreckage Saturday. 'It brings it very close to home,' she said. 'It is where they spent their last hours.' For some relatives, viewing the wreckage is just too hard. Yasmine Calehr, the grandmother of two brothers who died on MH17, lives in the United States and decided not to go see the wreckage. 'I... could not bear the sight of it,' she said in an email to The Associated Press. Yellow and black markers are seen on a parts of the wing of the wreckage. The aircraft registration number sits on the tail part of the wreckage of plane. The wreckage, spread across three hangars, included wings, wheels, parts of the fuselage and overhead luggage bins. The cause of the crash is expected to be established by the end of the summer. All 298 passengers and crew on board the flight from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur were killed.\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0,

"The members of Twisted Sister are profoundly saddened to announce the untimely passing of our brother, AJ Pero," said the post. "The band, crew and most importantly the family of AJ Pero thank you for your thoughts and prayers at this time." Pero was 55. Pero died of what appears to be a massive heart attack, his longtime agent Dan Stanton told CNN. "He had been complaining of a sore arm all week and took a few days off from his tour with the band Adrenaline Mob," says Stanton. Pero had been on a tour with the band in Poughkeepsie, New York, and was scheduled to play tonight, according to Stanton. Twisted Sister guitarist Jay Jay French told CNN that Pero was found this morning in his tour bus. He was taken to a hospital and died there. "We are devastated. He was a great guy and one of the best drummers," French said. "To lose someone you have depended on for 33 years... I don\'t know what it is going to be like to be on stage without him.  I can\'t even think about what it will be like." Twisted Sister frontman Dee Snider tweeted about the death. "Today I lost a brother. Anthony Jude Pero passed away," Snider said in a statement. "His sledgehammer assault on the drums helped drive Twisted Sister and I to greatness and inspired me to rock every single show. My heart breaks knowing I will never feel the power of his beat behind me, or turn to see his face smiling broadly from the sheer joy he got from doing what he loved." Pero joined Twisted Sister, best known for its 1984 song "We\'re Not Gonna Take It" and accompanying comedic video, in 1982. Though he left for a time in 1987 to join another band, he reunited with Twisted Sister in the 1990s and was with the band for the past 12 years, according to Loudwire.com. In the "We\'re Not Gonna Take It" video, which also starred "Animal House\'s" Mark Metcalf, Pero can be seen in concert, hitting a drum that brings up a cloud of glitter. In recent years, he was also the drummer for the band Adrenaline Mob. CNN\'s Tony Marco contributed to this story.\n\nSummary:', params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=128, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=False, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: [128000, 9370, 5730, 553, 279, 2768, 3754, 4652, 304, 220, 4386, 11460, 13, 5321, 2612, 279, 12399, 1193, 11, 2085, 904, 1023, 1495, 382, 17064, 512, 3100, 9944, 8, 32, 3587, 13, 56532, 11, 264, 36504, 69046, 369, 279, 9501, 7200, 12015, 13539, 48368, 11, 706, 8636, 11, 279, 7200, 8621, 389, 1202, 5690, 2199, 13, 330, 791, 3697, 315, 12015, 13539, 48368, 527, 66278, 95017, 311, 22203, 279, 13365, 318, 989, 12579, 315, 1057, 10868, 11, 34050, 56532, 1359, 1071, 279, 1772, 13, 330, 791, 7200, 11, 13941, 323, 1455, 23659, 279, 3070, 315, 34050, 56532, 9901, 499, 369, 701, 11555, 323, 34296, 520, 420, 892, 1210, 56532, 574, 220, 2131, 13, 56532, 8636, 315, 1148, 8111, 311, 387, 264, 11191, 4851, 3440, 11, 813, 36504, 8479, 11824, 81764, 3309, 20352, 13, 330, 1548, 1047, 1027, 42126, 315, 264, 36366, 6916, 682, 2046, 323, 3952, 264, 2478, 2919, 1022, 505, 813, 7364, 449, 279, 7200, 2467, 47738, 483, 36006, 1359, 2795, 81764, 13, 56532, 1047, 1027, 389, 264, 7364, 449, 279, 7200, 304, 393, 1409, 441, 7270, 648, 11, 1561, 4356, 11, 323, 574, 13847, 311, 1514, 18396, 11, 4184, 311, 81764, 13, 12015, 13539, 48368, 62740, 19455, 19455, 8753, 3309, 20352, 430, 56532, 574, 1766, 420, 6693, 304, 813, 7364, 5951, 13, 1283, 574, 4529, 311, 264, 8952, 323, 8636, 1070, 13, 330, 1687, 527, 59097, 13, 1283, 574, 264, 2294, 7564, 323, 832, 315, 279, 1888, 24074, 23621, 1359, 8753, 1071, 13, 330, 1271, 9229, 4423, 499, 617, 79101, 389, 369, 220, 1644, 1667, 1131, 358, 1541, 956, 1440, 1148, 433, 374, 2133, 311, 387, 1093, 311, 387, 389, 6566, 2085, 1461, 13, 220, 358, 649, 956, 1524, 1781, 922, 1148, 433, 690, 387, 1093, 1210, 12015, 13539, 48368, 4156, 1543, 56004, 13358, 1814, 27045, 922, 279, 4648, 13, 330, 15724, 358, 5675, 264, 10868, 13, 21353, 62734, 56532, 5946, 3201, 1359, 13358, 1814, 1071, 304, 264, 5224, 13, 330, 16366, 274, 4995, 46434, 11965, 389, 279, 47389, 9087, 6678, 12015, 13539, 48368, 323, 358, 311, 63556, 323, 14948, 757, 311, 7091, 1475, 3254, 1501, 13, 3092, 4851, 18808, 14392, 358, 690, 2646, 2733, 279, 2410, 315, 813, 9567, 4920, 757, 11, 477, 2543, 311, 1518, 813, 3663, 37163, 44029, 505, 279, 33638, 16267, 568, 2751, 505, 3815, 1148, 568, 10456, 1210, 56532, 11096, 12015, 13539, 48368, 11, 1888, 3967, 369, 1202, 220, 3753, 19, 5609, 330, 1687, 2351, 2876, 480, 13767, 12040, 1102, 1, 323, 24442, 95471, 2835, 11, 304, 220, 3753, 17, 13, 18056, 568, 2163, 369, 264, 892, 304, 220, 3753, 22, 311, 5249, 2500, 7200, 11, 568, 77979, 449, 12015, 13539, 48368, 304, 279, 220, 2550, 15, 82, 323, 574, 449, 279, 7200, 369, 279, 3347, 220, 717, 1667, 11, 4184, 311, 80648, 36631, 916, 13, 763, 279, 330, 1687, 2351, 2876, 480, 13767, 12040, 1102, 1, 2835, 11, 902, 1101, 59335, 330, 42515, 4783, 596, 1, 4488, 6344, 66, 3181, 11, 56532, 649, 387, 3970, 304, 21497, 11, 20129, 264, 24074, 430, 12716, 709, 264, 9624, 315, 55251, 13, 763, 3293, 1667, 11, 568, 574, 1101, 279, 69046, 369, 279, 7200, 2467, 47738, 483, 36006, 13, 20352, 596, 19036, 35281, 20162, 311, 420, 3446, 382, 19791, 25], prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

Please output the summary only, without any other text.\n\nArticle:\nThree weeks after the video footage taken on the Paris Metro which shamed Chelsea, an initiative is gathering support among fans to fight back against the racists who still attach themselves to the club. Paris Saint-Germain visit Stamford Bridge for the second leg of a Champions League tie which will be forever tarnished by those Chelsea supporters who refused to let Souleymane S board a train at Richelieu-Drouot station as they sang: 'We’re racist and that’s the way we like it'. Many Chelsea fans are keen to use the return fixture to send a collective message around the world, and have been inspired to produce flags, banners, posters and t-shirts to project the mood. The Paris Saint-Germain squad are put through their paces at Stamford Bridge on Tuesday evening. Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho addresses the media ahead of their return clash against Paris Saint-Germain. There will be posters, banners and flags showcasing Chelsea's stance against racism at Stamford Bridge. There will be posters handed out, printed in both English and French which state: 'No Racism at the Bridge. That’s the way we like it.' There will be t-shirts carrying the slogan 'We Only See Blue' and there will be flag hanging from the Matthew Harding Stand bearing a message: 'Blues Against Racism'. Souleymane has declined an invitation from Chelsea to attend the game but it is as if bearing witness to his experience, like something from Apartheid South Africa lurking amid the glitz of the Champions League, flicked a switch in the minds of thousands. Rather than cringe and ignore the ever-diminishing faction of racists who have lingered around Chelsea since the 1980s – and other clubs, it must be said - supporters are getting active at ground-level with campaigns which has the potential to be more powerful than all those well-intentioned messages from the top of society. Souleymane S has declined an invitation from Chelsea to attend Wednesday night's Champions League tie. Five of the Chelsea fans involved in the disgraceful incident have been suspended from attending matches. Since the Metro footage went viral, another two incidents of racist abuse involving Chelsea-associated yobs singing on trains have been reported to police and are being investigated. Ben Price, a 37-year-old gardener and Chelsea supporter since the early nineties, set up a Facebook page which he found gathered rapid support at home and abroad. Paul Canoville, the club’s first black player, was quick to back the movement, as was Richard West, aka Mr C, the DJ and former frontman for the Shamen, who is a Chelsea fan. Price was responsible for the 'No Racism at the Bridge' posters on show during the Burnley game, last month, and will be outside the Shed End, handing out more before the game against PSG. 'It’s a message that says that collectively we do not tolerate racism and we cannot be branded a racist club,' said Price. 'It’s a message for Souleymane S and for other clubs and their fans and for football’s authorities like UEFA and FIFA and hopefully we can send it around the world, because the eyes of the world will be on us.'\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=128, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=False, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: [128000, 9370, 5730, 553, 279, 2768, 3754, 4652, 304, 220, 4386, 11460, 13, 5321, 2612, 279, 12399, 1193, 11, 2085, 904, 1023, 1495, 382, 17064, 512, 20215, 5672, 1306, 279, 2835, 22609, 4529, 389, 279, 12366, 21631, 902, 559, 3690, 27616, 11, 459, 20770, 374, 23738, 1862, 4315, 7359, 311, 4465, 1203, 2403, 279, 9148, 1705, 889, 2103, 15866, 5694, 311, 279, 6469, 13, 12366, 14539, 12279, 261, 3902, 4034, 99387, 20467, 369, 279, 2132, 2531, 315, 264, 29908, 9130, 18623, 902, 690, 387, 16058, 87580, 3384, 555, 1884, 27616, 15879, 889, 16436, 311, 1095, 9424, 3258, 1543, 68, 328, 4580, 264, 5542, 520, 8269, 301, 26235, 9607, 583, 354, 8216, 439, 814, 29340, 25, 364, 1687, 3207, 25185, 323, 430, 753, 279, 1648, 584, 1093, 433, 4527, 9176, 27616, 7359, 527, 27989, 311, 1005, 279, 471, 12790, 311, 3708, 264, 22498, 1984, 2212, 279, 1917, 11, 323, 617, 1027, 14948, 311, 8356, 8202, 11, 59472, 11, 39568, 323, 259, 49760, 311, 2447, 279, 20247, 13, 578, 12366, 14539, 12279, 261, 3902, 19037, 527, 2231, 1555, 872, 281, 2492, 520, 99387, 20467, 389, 7742, 11714, 13, 27616, 6783, 11097, 66418, 14564, 279, 3772, 8469, 315, 872, 471, 41003, 2403, 12366, 14539, 12279, 261, 3902, 13, 2684, 690, 387, 39568, 11, 59472, 323, 8202, 67908, 27616, 596, 30031, 2403, 27052, 520, 99387, 20467, 13, 2684, 690, 387, 39568, 23415, 704, 11, 17124, 304, 2225, 6498, 323, 8753, 902, 1614, 25, 364, 2822, 56806, 2191, 520, 279, 20467, 13, 3011, 753, 279, 1648, 584, 1093, 433, 3238, 2684, 690, 387, 259, 49760, 15691, 279, 52637, 364, 1687, 8442, 3580, 8868, 6, 323, 1070, 690, 387, 5292, 21363, 505, 279, 19475, 97593, 15948, 18534, 264, 1984, 25, 364, 5028, 1157, 30241, 56806, 2191, 4527, 9424, 3258, 1543, 68, 706, 19284, 459, 29788, 505, 27616, 311, 9604, 279, 1847, 719, 433, 374, 439, 422, 18534, 11550, 311, 813, 3217, 11, 1093, 2555, 505, 362, 1768, 69455, 4987, 10384, 83075, 23442, 279, 2840, 11289, 315, 279, 29908, 9130, 11, 29447, 291, 264, 3480, 304, 279, 20663, 315, 9214, 13, 26848, 1109, 1589, 18177, 323, 10240, 279, 3596, 1773, 61334, 11218, 37480, 315, 9148, 1705, 889, 617, 40609, 291, 2212, 27616, 2533, 279, 220, 3753, 15, 82, 1389, 323, 1023, 19424, 11, 433, 2011, 387, 1071, 482, 15879, 527, 3794, 4642, 520, 5015, 11852, 449, 21343, 902, 706, 279, 4754, 311, 387, 810, 8147, 1109, 682, 1884, 1664, 20653, 3012, 291, 6743, 505, 279, 1948, 315, 8396, 13, 9424, 3258, 1543, 68, 328, 706, 19284, 459, 29788, 505, 27616, 311, 9604, 8079, 3814, 596, 29908, 9130, 18623, 13, 21594, 315, 279, 27616, 7359, 6532, 304, 279, 64935, 1285, 10672, 617, 1027, 22340, 505, 24096, 9248, 13, 8876, 279, 21631, 22609, 4024, 29962, 11, 2500, 1403, 24455, 315, 25185, 11737, 16239, 27616, 75968, 379, 5598, 26139, 389, 28788, 617, 1027, 5068, 311, 4379, 323, 527, 1694, 27313, 13, 7505, 8650, 11, 264, 220, 1806, 4771, 6418, 22641, 804, 323, 27616, 37563, 2533, 279, 4216, 20120, 26640, 11, 743, 709, 264, 5690, 2199, 902, 568, 1766, 20802, 11295, 1862, 520, 2162, 323, 22917, 13, 7043, 3053, 869, 4618, 11, 279, 6469, 753, 1176, 3776, 2851, 11, 574, 4062, 311, 1203, 279, 7351, 11, 439, 574, 12131, 4410, 11, 38241, 4491, 356, 11, 279, 22102, 323, 4846, 4156, 1543, 369, 279, 1443, 25807, 11, 889, 374, 264, 27616, 8571, 13, 8650, 574, 8647, 369, 279, 364, 2822, 56806, 2191, 520, 279, 20467, 6, 39568, 389, 1501, 2391, 279, 18530, 3258, 1847, 11, 1566, 2305, 11, 323, 690, 387, 4994, 279, 95552, 4060, 11, 52588, 704, 810, 1603, 279, 1847, 2403, 93777, 13, 364, 2181, 753, 264, 1984, 430, 2795, 430, 45925, 584, 656, 539, 50134, 27052, 323, 584, 4250, 387, 46935, 264, 25185, 6469, 2965, 1071, 8650, 13, 364, 2181, 753, 264, 1984, 369, 9424, 3258, 1543, 68, 328, 323, 369, 1023, 19424, 323, 872, 7359, 323, 369, 9141, 753, 11527, 1093, 79815, 323, 44742, 323, 23127, 584, 649, 3708, 433, 2212, 279, 1917, 11, 1606, 279, 6548, 315, 279, 1917, 690, 387, 389, 603, 22438, 19791, 25], prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

Last night, the producers of the forthcoming Spectre film confirmed that they were investigating the 'intimidatory and frightening' behaviour on board the privately chartered plane flying from Stansted Airport in Essex to Mexico City 11 days ago. The Mail on Sunday can reveal that charter aircraft company Hi Fly sent a damning a report to the Bond film production company Eon that revealed how some of the film's crew:. Scroll down for video. The British crew of the new James Bond film went on a drunken rampage aboard the official 007 jet, pictured  filming  in Mexico city last week - there is no suggestion those pictured were involved in rampage. The report also made clear that the reckless behaviour of some of the film crew, fuelled by excess alcohol, had 'compromised' the safety of the Airbus 330 and had breached international aviation regulations. Last night, a worker at Toluca airport in Mexico City said the mayhem had left the interior of the plane looking like a 'pack of wild animals' had gone through it. The source added that vomit had been left inside the toilet and on the floor outside. The producers of the forthcoming Spectre film, starring Monica Bellucci and Daniel Craig,\xa0confirmed that they were investigating the 'intimidatory and frightening' behaviour. He also claimed the airline had to bring in a specialist firm to clean the plane at a cost of 20,000 pesos – about £1,000. The incident will prove embarrassing for Eon, which only yesterday launched a glossy trailer for the new £190 million movie, which will again star Daniel Craig as 007. About 150 of the film's crew, including cameramen, technicians and stunt men, were on their way to Mexico to film some of the most spectacular action sequences, including one that takes place during Mexico's macabre Day of the Dead festival. It is understood that neither Craig nor any other member of the cast was on board the jet, which landed at Toluca Airport for the two-week shoot on March 18. Hi Fly, which has told Eon that its staff breached the conditions of the charter, will deploy extra security at the airport to ensure that no passengers arrive drunk for the jet's return journey to the UK on Wednesday. The airline has agreed to fly the crew back to Britain only on condition that no alcohol is served or consumed on board. The privately chartered plane (pictured) was flying from Stansted Airport in Essex to Mexico City 11 days ago. Members of the film crew\xa0removed a safety pin from one of the aircraft's doors - there is no suggestion those pictured were involved in rampage. Eon, led by Michael G. Wilson and his stepsister Barbara Broccoli, have now told staff that the flight will be 'dry'. However, in a twist worthy of the Bond films, it is unclear whether the American watchdog, the Federal Aviation Administration, is investigating the incident. On Friday night, spokeswoman Laura Brown confirmed that the incident was 'under investigation' but declined to comment further after being given a detailed account of the reckless behaviour on the plane. But the following day her colleagues denied any such probe was under way. The FAA has some jurisdiction over international airspace around the US, which could have been passed through by the 007 film crew's flight. A spokesman for Eon last night confirmed it was conducting an internal investigation to find out exactly what had happened. But The Mail on Sunday understands that Wilson and Broccoli read the riot act to staff at a production meeting held shortly after the plane's arrival in Mexico. They have also apologised to horrified air crew members. One source, who asked not to be named, said: 'Michael and Barbara have both made it very clear that this sort of behaviour is unacceptable and should never be allowed to happen again. It is understood that neither Craig (pictured) nor any other member of the cast was on board the jet. Some of the film's crew vomited and urinated in the aisles and verbally abused cabin crew -\xa0there is no suggestion those pictured were involved in rampage. 'The behaviour of a handful of crew members got out of hand and made things very unpleasant for their fellow passengers. 'Eon has apologised to all the crew members who had to endure this intolerable behaviour.' Airline expert Chris Yates said last night that 'it was entirely possible' that the removal of the safety pin could have caused the door to open. He said: 'The pin is part and parcel of the locking mechanism on the aircraft door. Essentially, if you remove it there is a possibility that you could potentially open the door and decompress the cabin.' However, while the risk was real, he added that in all likelihood the door would have been held shut by the speed of the plane moving through the air. Hi Fly, which is based in Lisbon, leases its 12 Airbuses to governments, companies and individuals. Last night, a spokesman declined to comment on the incident. He said: 'This particular flight from the UK to Mexico was a private charter, not open to the public. We have an obligation towards the privacy rights of our clients and therefore we are unable to comment.' A spokesman for Eon said: 'We are investigating the matter so cannot comment further at this time.' Spectre is the 24th movie in the Bond franchise and co-stars Christoph Waltz, Ralph Fiennes and Monica Bellucci. It is due to open in Britain in November.\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0,

Doctors have described the recoveries as ‘miraculous’, while patients say they have been given their lives back. The treatment uses a patient’s own stem cells – the body’s master cells – to fight the disease. Recovery: MS sufferer Holly Drewery\xa0became wheelchair-bound after the birth of daughter Isla, but thanks to\xa0the stem cell transplant she\xa0can dance, run and chase after Isla in the park. If it fulfils its early promise, it could be the first therapy that does not just slow the damage done by the condition, but reverses it. Professor Basil Sharrack, of the Royal Hallamshire Hospital in Sheffield, said: ‘Since we started treating patients some three years ago some of the results have been miraculous. Today, Holly Drewery can run after her daughter Isla. Two years ago she could take her for a walk only if someone pushed her wheelchair while she held on to Isla’s pushchair. Miss Drewery, 25, of Sheffield, pictured with Isla, was diagnosed with MS after suffering numbness and blurred vision. She became wheelchair-bound after her health worsened on Isla’s birth. She needed help with basic tasks and couldn’t even wiggle her toes. Three weeks after the stem cell transplant she was able to walk out of hospital. Now, more than 18 months on, she is almost back to normal. She has a part-time office job and, although she still gets tired, can dance, run and chase after Isla, two, in the park. She said: ‘All I wanted to be able to do is take Isla out. It worked wonders. I am more or less back to normal.’ Sam Ramsey collapsed when out celebrating her 22nd birthday and six weeks later was paralysed from the neck down by MS. Other treatments failed but now, after the stem cell treatment, Miss Ramsey, 25, of Newark in Nottinghamshire, can walk on crutches, has passed her driving test and ordered a car. She told the Sunday Times: ‘This treatment has given me my life back.’ 'This is not a word I would use lightly but we have seen profound neurological improvements.’ However, more research is needed to prove the patients are not just experiencing a temporary remission, which does happen in MS. The neurological condition, which is more common in women than men, usually strikes those in their 20s and 30s and affects 2.5million people worldwide, including 100,000 Britons. It can cause blindness and paralysis, but current drugs are not suitable for all and there is no cure. The disease occurs when ‘friendly fire’ from the body’s immune system destroys myelin, the fatty protective sheath around nerve fibres in the brain and spinal cord, disrupting the transmission of vital signals. The Sheffield treatment uses the stem cells to ‘reboot’ the immune system so that it stops attacking the body and brain. First, a sample of the patient’s blood is taken and stem cells are removed from it and stored. The patient is then given a high dose of chemotherapy to wipe out their faulty immune system. Finally, they are given their stem cells back. As master cells, they are able to form a new, healthy immune system. The transplant has a one-off cost of around £30,000, similar to the amount spent on some patients’ drugs each year. As well as stopping the disease in its tracks the treatment, known as autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation, seems to heal damage that has already been done. Sam Ramsey, 25, of Newark, pictured with her mother Tina, was paralysed as result of her MS, but now, after treatment, she can walk on crutches and has passed her driving test. A number of MS sufferers were given pioneering therapy at the Royal Hallamshire Hospital in Sheffield. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disease that attacks the central nervous system (the brain, spinal cord and optic nerves). The progress, severity and specific symptoms of MS cannot be predicted. MS is a lifelong disease for which a cause and cure are yet to be found; however, doctors and scientists are making discoveries about the treatment and management of MS every day. The visible and hidden symptoms of MS are unpredictable and vary from person to person and from time to time in the same person. However, symptoms can include difficulties walking, pain, dizziness, slurred speech, emotional and mood changes, memory problems and extreme tiredness. A man who was blind in one eye has almost normal vision again. A woman in Canada who needed 24-hour care appears free of MS more than a decade after being given a transplant of her own stem cells. Despite these dramatic improvements, the treatment is not suitable for all patients. A US trial on almost 150, reported last month in the Journal of the American Medical Association, showed it to help roughly half the time. There are also concerns about complications including potentially lethal infections. Professor Sharrack and colleagues are seeking patients with relapsing-remitting MS, the most common form, for an NHS-funded trial. The MS Society described the Sheffield work as ‘very encouraging’ and said it is eagerly awaiting the results of larger trials.\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0,

Please output the summary only, without any other text.\n\nArticle:\nAn horrifically burned 12-year-old boy was able to tell police it was his dad who started the fatal house fire that killed him and his nine-year-old brother, an inquest has heard. Salesman Darren Sykes, 44, lured his two boys Paul, 9, and his brother Jack, 12, to the attic with fun-size chocolate bars to play with a new model railway then set a fire downstairs and closed the loft hatch with all three inside. The bodies of Mr Sykes and Paul were found in the loft and Jack was rescued still conscious by firefighters from the bottom of the loft ladder but died five days later in hospital. Jack managed to tell a police officer and hospital consultant before he died from 50 per cent burns: 'It was my dad that started the fire' and 'My dad did it on purpose.' The fire, which was started deliberately by Mr Sykes (centre), killed himself along with his nine-year-old son Paul (left) and Jack (right), 12. Jack (right) and Paul Sykes were both killed in the house fire after being lured into the loft by their father who then set the home ablaze. Here the two boys are pictured with their mother Claire Throssell. Sheffield coroner Chris Dorries told the boys' tearful mother Claire Throssell: 'Your loss has deeply affected me.' He said she bore no blame for the tragedy and told her: 'You have nothing to blame yourself about.' The inquest heard Mr Sykes, worried over access rights to his children, 'coldly planned' the fire at his home 'with the specific purpose of ending two young lives'. Investigating officer Detective Sargent Stuart Hall said: 'I believe the children were almost lured into the loft by the newly purchased train track and fun-size chocolate bars which had been left there to maintain their attentions.' The inquest heard that Mr Sykes felt 'the world was against him' after a meeting with CAFCASS - which represents children in family courts two days before the tragedy. He formed the impression that Paul had said he only wanted to see his father for one hour a week during a discussion over visiting rights. Mr Sykes told his boss Andre Spencer in a phone call just over two hours before the inferno that he thought the CAFCASS visit was a 'waste of time' and 'they wanted to talk about negatives and didn't want to listen to his agenda'. Mr Spencer said: 'He was a dedicated father. His children were his number one priority. He talked about them to the point that he seemed obsessed and boring.' An inquest into the death of Paul (pictured bottom left and far right) and Jack was carried out today, where a coroner ruled their deaths were the result of an unlawful killing. Claire Throssell's son Jack clung to life in intensive care with his mother (pictured) at his bedside, but died five days later. He felt the access arrangements were 'barbaric' and he mistakenly believed Paul only wanted to see him for one hour a week. 'There's no point living,' he told his boss. Mr Spencer said he then went on: 'If anything did happen would I care for his boys.' CAFCASS family adviser Rona Murphy told the inquest in her dealings with the family Paul did want to see his father but only for a three-hour visit on one day a week. Paul had told her about 'issues of abuse' and described meal times as a 'battleground' because his dad 'wanted him to eat more and everything and he didn't want to.' She did not believe Mr Sykes was taking on board what she was telling him. 'He was saying how can I have any less contact than I already have.' Council social worker Julie Keen said four months before the tragedy she had a referral that Paul didn't want to go home from school and have contact with his father. The boys' heartbroken mother Claire Throssell (pictured at her sons' funeral) told the inquest her two children had'meant the world' to her. 'Paul said his dad was abusive to him and Jack,' she said. 'It was general physical and emotional abuse. On a skiing trip Paul claimed his dad had got him by the throat.' When Mr Sykes was challenged he apologised for his behaviour but was more focused on getting around a table with his then wife. Mr Sykes, lived in Penistone, South Yorkshire, after the split with his wife and his sons lived with her at their grandmother's in nearby Thurlstone. On the morning of the fire he contacted an investment company and withdrew his assets, transferring them into a female third party's account. He spent £600 on model railway track and equipment and sent a text to both his sons asking them to attend the former family home that evening to play with the new train set and be 'engine drivers'. Mr Sykes then bought petrol cans, some petrol and posted letters to family and friends and deliberately parked his van away from his house so neighbours would not realise anyone was at home. He picked up his sons on the evening of October 22 last year to play with the model railway and while they went up to the loft, he set the fire. The inquest heard that after he had barricaded the door after lighting a fire in the bottom floor of the house, he then came out of the house through the patio doors and walked round to the front door, letting himself in and locking it behind him. He took the keys upstairs before lighting more fires on the first floor, including in the children's bedrooms. Once this was done he then entered the loft, closing the hatch behind him. When the fire crew arrived it appeared Jack had bravely tried to get out of the loft as he was found by the bottom of the ladder. Mourners stand by as the caskets of Jack and Paul are carried from a church during their funeral in October. Mr Sykes sent the same text to six separate people saying he was 'going to be at peace'. A minute later, neighbours spotted the blaze and the fire service were called with the downstairs well ablaze. Cord had been tied to the front and back garden gates as a barricade and a dining chair placed between the kitchen door and the door to the stairs so nobody could escape downstairs. One of his letters to HSBC Bank said: 'I won't be paying the mortgage any more because I won't be alive.' Det Sgt Hall said numerous statements taken by the police showed he was at a 'particularly low point' in his life over visiting rights to his sons and took the view he would have less access. Specialist fire investigator Michael Mason said the carpet and furniture downstairs were well alight when firefighters arrived. 'The door to the stairs had been wedged to stop anyone coming down and there were chairs behind the front door as if to prevent people coming in,' he said. Two bodies were found in the loft - that of Mr Sykes and his son Paul - and Mr Sykes was declared dead on arrival at hospital. Pictured is the home where Paul Skyes killed his two sons after trapping them in the attic and starting a fire. Petrol was used as an accelerant to start the fire with 16 pools of fuel on the ground floor and first floor. A patio door had been left partly open downstairs to fan the flames. Mr Mason said: 'At some point during the fire the loft hatch was closed and then opened during the fire which allowed a plume of smoke with gases to enter the loft. It was a natural reaction to try and get out.' It emerged that it was Jack who opened the hatch and he was rescued conscious by firefighters but died five days later in hospital from his burns. Mr Sykes and Paul died from inhaling noxious fumes. In her statement, the boys' mother said: 'My boys meant the world to me. They were both polite, well mannered and caring, and you can't imagine life without them.' When asked by the coroner if there was anything she would like to add, she replied: 'There is nothing further I can add other than the guilt I that I carry for what has happened to them.' The coroner recorded a verdict on Monday that Mr Sykes committed suicide. Yesterday the verdict on the two boys was unlawful killing. Coroner Dorries said: 'This fire was set deliberately indeed the whole event was carefully planned by Mr Sykes to ensure a catastrophic fire while the boys were distracted by model railway equipment and sweets.'\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[],

An elderly patient suffering from dementia who wandered out of a scandal-hit hospital was found dead in a ditch the next day. Violet Burton’s body was discovered only a quarter of a mile from the grounds of Stoke Mandeville Hospital. She appears to have died from hypothermia, although the cause of death has not yet been made public. The hospital has begun an urgent investigation into how Mrs Burton, 79, said to be a ‘known wanderer’, was able to walk out of the hospital, wearing only a cardigan and trousers. She was reportedly seen by a member of staff but not stopped. The hospital’s latest Care Quality Commission report said it ‘required improvement’ in a number of areas, including in caring for those with dementia. The watchdog’s report, following an inspection in June 2014, stated: ‘The support for patients living with dementia or who may have a learning disability was inconsistent.’ It also raised concerns about staff levels, saying there was a ‘heavy reliance’ on agency staff which, in some instances, ‘affected the delivery and continuity of patient care’. Last month, the hospital, in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, was criticised in a scathing report into the actions of Jimmy Savile. It found that the disgraced BBC disc jockey had been allowed to abuse 68 victims there, including a boy of eight. Savile joined the hospital as a porter in 1968 and effectively lived there for more than 30 years. The report found that ten complaints were made about him, but none was ‘taken seriously’. Those who tried to blow the whistle were rebuked because senior managers thought Savile was an asset to the hospital. Mrs Burton, known as Vi Ann, was admitted to the hospital on March 7 after she was reportedly found wandering in her home village of Aston Clinton, which is near the hospital. She was described as a ‘sweet lady’ and was well known in the area, where she was often seen walking her 17-year-old dog. Stoke Mandeville (pictured), run by Buckinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust, said it had launched an internal review into the incident. She was apparently seen by a member of staff leaving the Medicine for Older People area of the hospital on Monday. Thames Valley Police issued an appeal for information, but Mrs Burton’s body was found in the ditch at noon on Tuesday. She was awaiting an assessment by Buckinghamshire County Council’s social services team when she went missing. A hospital source told The Independent: ‘Her death couldn’t have happened at a worse time. The CQC had issues they were concerned about so they’ve come back for a visit and one of the things they’re looking at is patient safety. The hospital still has serious problems.’ An independent investigation into the abuse by Jimmy Savile found he had sexually abused more than 50 people at Stoke Mandeville, including staff, patients and visitors with the youngest victim aged just eight. Buckinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust, which runs the hospital, said: ‘Our deepest sympathies are with Mrs Burton’s family at this very difficult time. We respect the family’s privacy and it would be inappropriate for us to share information about any care Mrs Burton was receiving. ‘Stoke Mandeville is a general, open hospital and, as with other district general hospitals, patients are free to move around the site. We have security measures that are appropriate for each clinical environment and processes in place should an alarm be raised.’ Police said they were not treating her death as suspicious. A file has been passed to the coroner.\n\nSummary:', params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=128, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=False, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: [128000, 9370, 5730, 553, 279, 2768, 3754, 4652, 304, 220, 4386, 11460, 13, 5321, 2612, 279, 12399, 1193, 11, 2085, 904, 1023, 1495, 382, 17064, 512, 53, 32012, 54755, 11, 220, 4643, 11, 574, 1766, 5710, 304, 264, 50104, 264, 8502, 315, 264, 14929, 505, 84697, 24789, 5230, 4618, 15429, 13, 1556, 29920, 8893, 16066, 505, 52857, 889, 82294, 704, 315, 264, 26681, 70201, 8952, 574, 1766, 5710, 304, 264, 50104, 279, 1828, 1938, 13, 74574, 54755, 753, 2547, 574, 11352, 1193, 264, 8502, 315, 264, 14929, 505, 279, 21319, 315, 84697, 24789, 5230, 4618, 15429, 13, 3005, 8111, 311, 617, 8636, 505, 9950, 1605, 91299, 11, 8051, 279, 5353, 315, 4648, 706, 539, 3686, 1027, 1903, 586, 13, 578, 8952, 706, 22088, 459, 34771, 8990, 1139, 1268, 18083, 54755, 11, 220, 4643, 11, 1071, 311, 387, 264, 3451, 5391, 40320, 261, 20182, 574, 3025, 311, 4321, 704, 315, 279, 8952, 11, 12512, 1193, 264, 3786, 11118, 323, 68776, 13, 3005, 574, 18307, 3970, 555, 264, 4562, 315, 5687, 719, 539, 10717, 13, 578, 8952, 753, 5652, 10852, 18410, 9849, 1934, 1071, 433, 3451, 6413, 16048, 529, 304, 264, 1396, 315, 5789, 11, 2737, 304, 30598, 369, 1884, 449, 52857, 13, 578, 48011, 753, 1934, 11, 2768, 459, 26767, 304, 5651, 220, 679, 19, 11, 11224, 25, 3451, 791, 1862, 369, 6978, 5496, 449, 52857, 477, 889, 1253, 617, 264, 6975, 28353, 574, 40240, 14639, 1102, 1101, 9408, 10742, 922, 5687, 5990, 11, 5605, 1070, 574, 264, 3451, 89945, 54180, 529, 389, 9266, 5687, 902, 11, 304, 1063, 13422, 11, 3451, 32157, 279, 9889, 323, 50106, 315, 8893, 2512, 24535, 8155, 2305, 11, 279, 8952, 11, 304, 362, 2552, 20176, 11, 96011, 15255, 11, 574, 60479, 304, 264, 1156, 44661, 1934, 1139, 279, 6299, 315, 28933, 20680, 458, 13, 1102, 1766, 430, 279, 45286, 4535, 18588, 2624, 503, 18369, 1047, 1027, 5535, 311, 11737, 220, 2614, 12697, 1070, 11, 2737, 264, 8334, 315, 8223, 13, 20680, 458, 11096, 279, 8952, 439, 264, 88286, 304, 220, 5162, 23, 323, 13750, 12439, 1070, 369, 810, 1109, 220, 966, 1667, 13, 578, 1934, 1766, 430, 5899, 21859, 1051, 1903, 922, 1461, 11, 719, 7000, 574, 3451, 83261, 14243, 24535, 13266, 889, 6818, 311, 12523, 279, 40649, 1051, 12646, 3178, 291, 1606, 10195, 20258, 3463, 20680, 458, 574, 459, 9513, 311, 279, 8952, 13, 18083, 54755, 11, 3967, 439, 11655, 9489, 11, 574, 16584, 311, 279, 8952, 389, 5587, 220, 22, 1306, 1364, 574, 18307, 1766, 55063, 304, 1077, 2162, 14458, 315, 66774, 8283, 11, 902, 374, 3221, 279, 8952, 13, 3005, 574, 7633, 439, 264, 3451, 95928, 17240, 529, 323, 574, 1664, 3967, 304, 279, 3158, 11, 1405, 1364, 574, 3629, 3970, 11689, 1077, 220, 1114, 4771, 6418, 5679, 13, 84697, 24789, 5230, 4618, 320, 69389, 705, 1629, 555, 96011, 15255, 39435, 37381, 17236, 11, 1071, 433, 1047, 11887, 459, 5419, 3477, 1139, 279, 10672, 13, 3005, 574, 14132, 3970, 555, 264, 4562, 315, 5687, 9564, 279, 19152, 369, 55025, 9029, 3158, 315, 279, 8952, 389, 7159, 13, 82288, 13345, 10289, 11136, 459, 14638, 369, 2038, 11, 719, 18083, 54755, 753, 2547, 574, 1766, 304, 279, 50104, 520, 38245, 389, 7742, 13, 3005, 574, 45088, 459, 15813, 555, 96011, 15255, 6406, 9251, 753, 3674, 3600, 2128, 994, 1364, 4024, 7554, 13, 362, 8952, 2592, 3309, 578, 22765, 25, 3451, 21364, 4648, 7846, 1431, 617, 7077, 520, 264, 11201, 892, 13, 578, 356, 62142, 1047, 4819, 814, 1051, 11920, 922, 779, 814, 4070, 2586, 1203, 369, 264, 4034, 323, 832, 315, 279, 2574, 814, 3207, 3411, 520, 374, 8893, 7296, 13, 578, 8952, 2103, 706, 6129, 5435, 14639, 1556, 9678, 8990, 1139, 279, 11737, 555, 28933, 20680, 458, 1766, 568, 1047, 27681, 36665, 810, 1109, 220, 1135, 1274, 520, 84697, 24789, 5230, 4618, 11, 2737, 5687, 11, 6978, 323, 15613, 449, 279, 39637, 11996, 20330, 1120, 8223, 13, 96011, 15255, 39435, 37381, 17236, 11, 902, 8640, 279, 8952, 11, 1071, 25, 3451, 8140, 51621, 33818, 552, 527, 449, 18083, 54755, 753, 3070, 520, 420, 1633, 5107, 892, 13, 1226, 5201, 279, 3070, 753, 12625, 323, 433, 1053, 387, 33781, 369, 603, 311, 4430, 2038, 922, 904, 2512, 18083, 54755, 574, 12588, 13, 3451, 626, 4845, 24789, 5230, 4618, 374, 264, 4689, 11, 1825, 8952, 323, 11, 439, 449, 1023, 9474, 4689, 24461, 11, 6978, 527, 1949, 311, 3351, 2212, 279, 2816, 13, 1226, 617, 4868, 11193, 430, 527, 8475, 369, 1855, 14830, 4676, 323, 11618, 304, 2035, 1288, 459, 17035, 387, 9408, 14639, 10289, 1071, 814, 1051, 539, 27723, 1077, 4648, 439, 32427, 13, 362, 1052, 706, 1027, 5946, 311, 279, 22760, 261, 382, 19791, 25], prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

A domineering husband tried to murder his wife by stabbing her 15 times after she said she wanted to take up English lessons. Nazakat Ali, 30, stabbed his 27-year old partner Shahzana Kausar during a row at their home in Rochdale, Greater Manchester, after she made it clear she wanted to enrol at college to study English. Manchester Crown Court heard how he grabbed a knife and, in front of his own mother, stabbed his wife more than a dozen times as he refused to accept that she wanted to gain a \'degree of independence\'. Following the attack on September 29 last year, Ali fled the scene and Ms Kausar was left lying in a pool of the blood on the floor. She was later flown to hospital where doctors carried out two emergency operations to heal stab wounds to her neck, collarbone, abdomen, ribs and a severed artery which caused her to lose one third of her body\'s blood. Ali has now pleaded guilty to attempted murder and has been jailed for 14 years by the judge who called him a \'dangerous man\'. The court heard how the incident unfolded after Ms Kausar returned home from the Jobcentre and told her husband that she had been advised to enrol at college to improve her English. He told his mother, who was living with the couple at the property, that he was not going to allow his wife to join the course, and an argument ensued. The couple had known each other for 16 years and married in Pakistan in 2005 before moving to the UK together in 2008. Mark Kellet, prosecuting, said: \'When the defendant and Shahzana were upstairs in their bedroom, he became angry and started shouting and slapped her across the head. She asked for her mobile phone so she could contact her sister or the police, but he refused to return it. \'She left the house to walk to her sister\'s address but was followed by the defendant. She asked for help from a bystander but the defendant apologised and they returned home. Once they had returned home they sat in the kitchen with the defendant\'s mother. \'Shahzana told the defendant if he were to behave in a similar manner again, she would leave him. \'He became angry and punched her, knocking her to the floor. He picked up a knife from a kitchen drawer and repeatedly stabbed her. \'She described it as "the way he stabbed me, it was like dying". She begged him to stop, which he did, before running from the house.\' Ali\'s mother provided a statement to the court which said the pair had been abusive towards each other and Ali had stabbed his wife when she ran at him. When Ms Kausar was taken to hospital, X-rays revealed she had blood within her chest, which had to be drained, and that she was bleeding from an artery. She also had further stab wounds to her liver, colon and pancreas. She has since started to recover from her injuries but is still undergoing surgical treatment and has a constant pain in her left shoulder. She said the incident had changed her life significantly and that she had even even contemplated self-harm as a result of the attack. Ali stabbed his wife after becoming angry at their home in Rochdale, Greater Manchester (pictured), when she told him she wanted to enrol at college to learn English. He left her for dead after the attack and fled the scene. The court heard how Ali handed himself in to police the day after the attack. The judge was also told how he was convicted in 2009 for his part in a burglary in which he and an accomplice forced their way into a family home, gagged a 40-year-old woman and threatened her and her baby with a screwdriver. Ian Harris, defending, said: \'His family have told me that when they visited the defendant he has been in tears when he has discussed what he did. \'A letter he has written may be starting to point towards maturity which clearly hasn\'t been demonstrated hitherto. He has set out how deeply sorry and remorseful he is for his actions towards his wife and family. \'It is a case of loss of temper. An intent to kill formed in the heat of the moment. The incident itself would have taken a matter of seconds.\' Passing sentence, Judge David Stockdale QC told Ali: \'There was an argument between you, triggered, it seems, by her express wish to attend a college course to improve her English. \'That wish was, in my judgement, a wish for a degree of independence on her part, which you would not tolerate. \'Your desire to dominate and control her, it seems to me, lies at the heart of the dreadful events which were to follow. \'The attack was sustained and repeated. There was extensive life-threatening internal injuries. You took a lethal bladed weapon and used it repeatedly on a defenceless woman - your own wife in her own home. \'You are, in my judgement, a dangerous man. I am unhesitatingly of the opinion there is a significant risk of serious harm from future offences committed by you.\' Following the sentencing, detective sergeant Louise Ashurst described the attempted murder as \'one of the most brutal and horrific attacks I have experienced as a detective.\' She said: \'The injuries she suffered were so severe that the first officer on the scene thought she was dead, her defensive injuries showed that he stabbed her with such force that the knife went right through her hand, breaking her forefinger. \'It was only after the officer felt for her pulse, that he realised she was still alive and even then it was touch and go, with the victim undergoing life-threatening surgery and several harrowing weeks in intensive care. \'But the victim was strong and brave, and I hope this sentence goes some way to helping her overcome what has happened.\'\n\nSummary:', params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0,

Dustin Ellermann, a self-taught marksman and avid hunter, is captured on camera applying the rashers of bacon to his Gemtech TREK 5.56mm suppressor that rests on the back of a pick-up truck. Either Dustin or the video maker mutters under their breath: ‘So much America right now’, before the competitive shooter secures the bacon in place with some tin foil, which is also wrapped around the suppressor. Getting into position, Dustin lifts his Pre-86 M16 Lower rifle and begins firing rounds of Wolf 223 – spraying shells in every direction. Pausing to reload Dustin laughs and says: ‘I was like, what’s that sound?’ Referring to the sizzling noise coming from the suppressor of his gun. Dustin fires more bullets before pausing once again to examine his rifle. Dustin wraps the suppressor of his M16 rifle in bacon (left) before securely covering it in tin foil (right) This time smoke billows from the tip of it and the sizzling of the bacon cooking can be heard even more clearly. The competitive shooter fires one last time and the vibrations caused by the bullets leaving the gun cause the tin foil to fly from the suppressor. Stopping to admire the bacon, Dustin says: ‘There’s nothing wrong with that’ before taking his gun back to the pick-up truck. Dustin fires around 90 rounds with the intention to heat the suppressor so much that it will cook the bacon. The competitive shooter laughs at the camera as the bacon wrapped around his gun's suppressor begins to sizzle. Once there, Dustin uses a pair of tongs to remove the bacon and utters in excitement as it unravels looking, if anything, slightly overdone. The thread mount suppressor used in the video is made from stainless steel and an Inconel alloy, which allows it to function under high heat and pressure. The video concludes with the shooter, clearly impressed with the outcome, wolfing down the bacon. Dustin uses a pair of tongs to remove the surprisingly well-cooked bacon from the end of the gun. Laughing he says: ‘Let’s go and kill some more pigs’ before rubbing his hands together in satisfaction. Dustin Ellermann was a competitor on the third season of the History Channel's marksmen competition ‘Top Shot’, which he later won. Born into a small community in Zavalla, Texas – where the video takes place – the competitive shooter is also the director of a Christian camp. The competitive shooter appears visibly impressed with the results as he begins wolfing down the bacon.\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=128, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=False, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: [128000, 9370, 5730, 553, 279, 2768, 3754, 4652, 304, 220, 4386, 11460, 13, 5321, 2612, 279, 12399, 1193, 11, 2085, 904, 1023, 1495, 382, 17064, 512, 32, 15022, 32671, 20097, 2225, 813, 30168, 3695, 555, 42295, 813, 6166, 304, 41452, 323, 1701, 279, 8798, 8066, 994, 23677, 311, 4394, 323, 8343, 433, 13, 79418, 13852, 92550, 11, 264, 659, 2442, 64, 3948, 15785, 1543, 323, 56653, 40827, 11, 374, 17439, 389, 6382, 19486, 279, 57342, 388, 315, 41452, 311, 813, 32245, 18261, 77986, 42, 220, 20, 13, 3487, 3906, 28321, 269, 430, 54331, 389, 279, 1203, 315, 264, 3820, 5352, 11092, 13, 21663, 79418, 477, 279, 2835, 25214, 5318, 5153, 1234, 872, 11745, 25, 3451, 4516, 1790, 5270, 1314, 1457, 20182, 1603, 279, 15022, 32671, 5819, 1439, 279, 41452, 304, 2035, 449, 1063, 25826, 47499, 11, 902, 374, 1101, 20037, 2212, 279, 28321, 269, 13, 25531, 1139, 2361, 11, 79418, 54166, 813, 5075, 12, 4218, 386, 845, 28636, 29232, 323, 12302, 23677, 20101, 315, 26296, 220, 12533, 1389, 83636, 44054, 304, 1475, 5216, 13, 16056, 985, 311, 19161, 79418, 49336, 323, 2795, 25, 3451, 40, 574, 1093, 11, 1148, 753, 430, 5222, 45258, 8718, 14782, 311, 279, 274, 90219, 12248, 5108, 505, 279, 28321, 269, 315, 813, 6166, 13, 79418, 27176, 810, 34164, 1603, 7251, 985, 3131, 1578, 311, 21635, 813, 29232, 13, 79418, 40809, 279, 28321, 269, 315, 813, 386, 845, 29232, 304, 41452, 320, 2414, 8, 1603, 52123, 18702, 433, 304, 25826, 47499, 320, 1315, 8, 1115, 892, 16603, 4121, 4336, 505, 279, 11813, 315, 433, 323, 279, 274, 90219, 315, 279, 41452, 17677, 649, 387, 6755, 1524, 810, 9539, 13, 578, 15022, 32671, 27176, 832, 1566, 892, 323, 279, 78352, 9057, 555, 279, 34164, 9564, 279, 6166, 5353, 279, 25826, 47499, 311, 11722, 505, 279, 28321, 269, 13, 800, 7153, 311, 50863, 279, 41452, 11, 79418, 2795, 25, 3451, 3947, 753, 4400, 5076, 449, 430, 529, 1603, 4737, 813, 6166, 1203, 311, 279, 3820, 5352, 11092, 13, 79418, 27176, 2212, 220, 1954, 20101, 449, 279, 14944, 311, 8798, 279, 28321, 269, 779, 1790, 430, 433, 690, 4394, 279, 41452, 13, 578, 15022, 32671, 49336, 520, 279, 6382, 439, 279, 41452, 20037, 2212, 813, 6166, 596, 28321, 269, 12302, 311, 274, 44237, 13, 9843, 1070, 11, 79418, 5829, 264, 6857, 315, 259, 13483, 311, 4148, 279, 41452, 323, 8791, 5153, 304, 28361, 439, 433, 41480, 402, 2053, 3411, 11, 422, 4205, 11, 10284, 927, 10655, 13, 578, 4617, 6606, 28321, 269, 1511, 304, 279, 2835, 374, 1903, 505, 25468, 9699, 323, 459, 763, 444, 301, 46964, 11, 902, 6276, 433, 311, 734, 1234, 1579, 8798, 323, 7410, 13, 578, 2835, 45537, 449, 279, 32671, 11, 9539, 25408, 449, 279, 15632, 11, 37642, 287, 1523, 279, 41452, 13, 79418, 5829, 264, 6857, 315, 259, 13483, 311, 4148, 279, 29392, 1664, 23283, 11059, 41452, 505, 279, 842, 315, 279, 6166, 13, 84135, 287, 568, 2795, 25, 3451, 10267, 753, 733, 323, 5622, 1063, 810, 49910, 529, 1603, 57035, 813, 6206, 3871, 304, 24617, 13, 79418, 13852, 92550, 574, 264, 43940, 389, 279, 4948, 3280, 315, 279, 11346, 13740, 596, 1906, 3647, 268, 10937, 3451, 5479, 33447, 20182, 902, 568, 3010, 2834, 13, 38916, 1139, 264, 2678, 4029, 304, 1901, 402, 21575, 11, 8421, 1389, 1405, 279, 2835, 5097, 2035, 1389, 279, 15022, 32671, 374, 1101, 279, 7690, 315, 264, 9052, 3190, 13, 578, 15022, 32671, 8111, 74106, 25408, 449, 279, 3135, 439, 568, 12302, 37642, 287, 1523, 279, 41452, 382, 19791, 25], prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

Celebrating in the corner were a group of giddy England players, while slumped in the penalty area were clutch of crestfallen Germans. Shouldn’t it be the other way around? Important matches between these two old foes tend to end one way and rarely is the outcome happy for England. Under-21 head coach Gareth Southgate, after all, knows that better than most. But this was no apparition: two goals in two minutes from Nathan Redmond and James Ward-Prowse provided further evidence this squad Southgate has impressively moulded is an emerging force. When Euro 2015 starts 80 days from now, do not doubt they possess what it takes to win it. This 3-2 win at a rain sodden Riverside Stadium, achieved after they had trailed twice, was stamped with the qualities of a team that can win a major tournament: quality, technique and spirit coming to the fore. Never was it more evident than when Ward-Prowse scored the decisive goal. James Ward-Prowse wheels away in celebration after scoring the winner in England Under 21's 3-2 defeat of Germany. The Southampton midfielder completed an unlikely comeback that saw two late goals scored in the space of three minutes. Nathan Redmond leaps for joy after bringing England level at 2-2 with a deflected shot in the second half. England were heading towards defeat before Redmond's strike on 79minutes brought them back into the game. Jesse Lindgard brought England level for the first time with a composed finish from Carl Jenkinson's cross in the first half. Germany striker Philipp Hofmann scored a brace but could not prevent the Young Lions from a memorable victory. Hofmann slides in in front of Everton defender John Stones to restore Germany's lead at the start of the second half. ENGLAND (4-2-3-1): Bond 6.5: Jenkinson 7.5, Stones 7, Gibson 6.5 (Keane 77mins), Garbutt 6.5: Ward-Prowse 7.5, Forster-Caskey 7: Lingard 7.5, Hughes 6.5 (Pritchard 65mins 6), Redmond 8: Ings 7.

Booked: Leitner. Scorers: Hofmann 15, 50. Man of the match: Carl Jenkinson. Referee: Davide Massa (Italy) 7. Expectations of a bold show in the Czech Republic can now build but Southgate, who has only lost one of the 16 games for which he has been in charge, was rather more circumspect. Yes, he was pleased but he was also quick to sound a note of caution. ‘How do I keep a check on expectations,’ he asked. ‘That’s easy. I’ll just show people the first 25 minutes of this game. We have tremendous belief in this group of players and some elements of what they did really pleased me. Other aspects showed we can definitely improve.’ The last time Southgate had stood in the technical area of this particular stadium, it came before one of the darkest moments of his career: the events of October 20, 2009, when he was sacked by Middlesbrough, will never leave him. He returned, however, a more confident and mature manager and he has thrived in this role with the FA, getting the Under-21s playing a vibrant, attractive brand of football that will see them go to the Czech Republic with genuine ambitions of success. Germany, though, will go there with the same mind-set and there is no doubt they will be big players when the tournament starts because of the big players they have in their ranks; Marc-Andre Ter Stegen, the Barcelona keeper, Emre Can of Liverpool and Max Meyer of Schalke to name but three. They started this contest impressively, moving the ball with purpose and ambition and in the first 10 minutes England had trouble getting out of their own half. Germany retained possession with ease and there was an inevitability they would strike first. When Germany broke the deadlock, they did it in style. Matthias Ginter skipper down the left and clipped in a cross that Philipp Hofmann, celebrating his 22nd birthday, controlled with his right foot before smashing a drive beyond Jonathon Bond with his left. For a moment it seemed like Germany might go through the gears but this England team has spirit as well as ability and their speed caused problems; Lingard (twice) and Danny Ings both tested Stegen before Lingard’s industry was rewarded in the 34th minute and parity was restored. Half-time arrived and checked England’s momentum. Germany made changes and the introduction of Arsenal flyer Serge Gnabry gave them blistering pace and trickery to attack Everton left-bacl Luke Garbutt. He made an immediate impact, thrilling providing Hofmann’s second of the night. Yet England were not done and they staged a grandstand comeback, Redmond equalised in the 78th minute before Ward-Prowse won it when bursting through. The players, then, can start to dream and, perhaps in a quiet moment, Southgate will too. ‘We have not achieved anything yet,’ he said. ‘We know what our goal is and we want to get there.’ Hoffman, who plays in Germany's second division, strikes to open the scoring for Germany after 15minutes. The Germany striker wheels away in celebration after handing the visitors the lead in this international friendly. Germany players celebrate after opening the scoring, but left the Riverside Stadium in shock after England's comeback victory. Liverpool and Germany midfielder/defender Emre Can (right) slides in for a tackle on England's Jake Forster-Caskey. England Under 21 manager Gareth Southgate looks on at the stadium where he spent his career as a player and manager. Lingard watches his composed finish find the net after meeting a right wing pass from Carl Jenkinson. The Manchester United forward races off to celebrate his first goal for England's Under 21s. England team-mates race to congratulate Lingard for bringing them level while fans rise from their seats. Burnley forward Danny Ings embraces Lingard as the two teams head in level at half time. Liverpool target Ings tries to take the ball under control as England start to get back into the game. Hoffman takes advantage of an England lapse of concentration after the break to net his second goal. Derby County forward Will Hughes strolls forward with the ball from midfield as England withstand pressure. England's perseverance paid off when Redmond brought the sides level for a second time with a deflected shot. The Norwich City forward can not contain his pleasure as he celebrates his equaliser in front of England fans.

Please output the summary only, without any other text.\n\nArticle:\nCelebrities are donning stockings on their head to show support for a seven-year-old girl who lost her hair after her cancer treatment. The social media craze, known as #tighthairdo, was inspired by schoolgirl Jordyn Miller who found a creative way to cope with bullies after she was teased for losing her her hair due to chemotherapy. As people became aware of little girl's experience, they have posted photos on social media with stocking on their heads just like Jordyn did in a sign of solidarity, accompanied by a hashtag declaring 'Jordyn is beautiful'. TV chef Manu Feildel, Big Brother winner Tim Dormer, Olympic swimmer Eamon Sullivan and presenter Jessica Rowe are just some of the people that have ptaken part to raise money to help children recovering from cancer battles. Scroll down for video. Jordyn Miller (left) was diagnosed with stage one cancer when she was five. She and her sister Charli (right) would wear tights and tea-towels on their heads to help Jordyn cope with losing her beloved hair. Big Brother winner Tim Dormer posed with tights on his head to support little Jordyn and encourage people to donate to help children with cancer. Celebrity chef Manu Feildel and TV presenter Jessica Rowe also joined in to help Jordyn and Camp Quality. On her first day of school, the six-year-old refused to remove her hat and was bullied for 'looking like a boy' At just five-years-old Jordyn was diagnosed with 'Wilm's tumor', a cancer of the kidneys. After five months of chemotherapy and a long recovery from surgery, the kindergarten student was so nervous to return to school that she refused to remove her hat. The little girl from Wingham on the north coast of New South Wales, was upset after losing her long, wavy hair. 'She used to have beautiful, long curly hair that she used to love – she's a very girly girl and the chemo caused it to fall out which was a big deal for Jordyn,' Her mother Tarin Miller,33, told Daily Mail Australia. Unfortunately, her fear that the other kids would make fun of her was not unfounded. 'When she first started school, she was shy about it and kids being kids used to tease her about looking like a boy. They'd call her ugly.' One of her daughter's coping mechanisms was to wear a pair of tights or a tea-towel on her head. 'One day Jordan just come out of her room with the tights on her head and said 'this is my beautiful long hair' and Charli, being her little sister, just copied,' she said. Newsreader Mark Ferguson and Olympic swimmer Eamon Sullivan also posed with tights on their head. Members of the Sydney Kings basketball team posed in colourful stockings to help kids with cancer. The kindergarten student had her left kidney removed after she was found to have a Wilms tumour. The sibling would spend entire days with tea towels or tights on their heads, even enlisting their cousin whenever she would visit. Camp Quality posted the pictures on their Facebook page. The beautiful images of Charli and Jordyn grinning with their stocking hair were shared widely. Touched by the image of sisterly support, people chose to join in by posting images of themselves with tights on their head with #tighthairdo and #jordynisbeautiful. Camp Quality decided to use the opportunity to start a social media campaign, inspired by the success of the 2014 craze, the Ice Bucket Challenge. The challenge raised money for ALS by asking people to throw icy buckets of water on their heads, donate money to the cause and nominate friends to do the same. Jordyn, pictured with her parents Tarin and Anthony (left), also underwent five months of chemotherapy in which she lost all her hair. TV chef Miguel Maestre also wanted people to wear tights and nominate people to help raise money for puppet shows which help make school children aware of how to be kind and considerate of children returning to school after cancer treatment. Camp Quality set up a text donation platform, so people could donate to nominate the next friends they wanted to see post a #tighthairdo. Celebrities who have already gotten behind the campaign and posted a #tighthairdo include TV chef Manu Feildel, Big Brother winner Tim Dormer, Olympic swimmers Eamon Sullivan and Alicia Coutts and former Vogue Editor Kirstie Clements. News presenter Mark Ferguson, TV presenter Jessica Rowe and Sydney Kings basketball players have also shown their support for Jordyn and all children undergoing cancer treatment. Jana Cooper, Camp Quality's Marketing Manager, said: 'The point of difference between this campaign and the Ice Bucket Challenge or the #nomakeupselfie, is that the whole idea centres around kids.' 'It was created by kids, it raises money for kids and we've seen many kids get involved. Something else that makes it unique is that it was born in Australia and it uses an Australian text donation service. To be involved, people simply need to text 'Jordyn' to 0476 000 222 to donate. Camp Quality has been performing a puppet show in schools across the country to encourage students to support \xa0their peers who are suffering or recovering from cancer. All funds donated to the campaign will help fund Camp Quality’s touring puppet show for schools. These shows teach pupils how to be supportive and understanding of kids living with cancer. The performance is incredibly effective in preventing and tackling teasing, staring and name-calling when a child returns to school post-treatment. A urine infection led to the discovery of a tumour in Jordyn's left kidney. She was quickly diagnosed with stage one cancer and was signed up for surgery to remove the organ. According to Gary Nunn from the cancer charity Camp Quality, Jordyn is one of 10,000 children across Australia who are currently newly diagnosed, under treatment or in remission from cancer treatment. The show discourages bullying and expels myths that children hold about cancer, including that it is contagious, encouraging them to support and include kids with. Mr Nunn told Daily Mail Australia that after all the emotional and physical hardships endured by the children throughout their treatment, just as things are starting to look up, one of the most common problems they encounter is bullying. 'We've heard about everything from pointing and staring and:'mummy, why does she looks so different?' to exclusion and isolation,' Mr Nunn said. 'Exclusion is one of the more common ones, kids are often left out because other kids think that they can catch cancer and it's contagious. 'We hear it a lot and there was one incident of name calling recently where we had a mum ringing us up and saying her daughter was being called 'baldie' and some of the kids were taking off her beanie and throwing it and playing catch with it'. Camp Quality is determined to change this mentality and teach children that there is no need to cover up the effects of their cancer treatment, while educating their peers about how to be supportive and understanding of kids living with cancer. The charity has been roaming the country with their educational puppet show on the request of parents and teachers, to expel the myths around cancer. Gary Nunn, a spokesperson for the cancer charity, said that by the end of the show,the kids are all cheering for the bald puppet character to take off her hat. Former Vogue editor Kirstie Clements posted a photo on Twitter encouraging people to take part in the Camp Quality campaign. Their show has been viewed by over 230,000 children in the last year and relies on public support to continue running. It involves a bald cancer-patient puppet who tries to decide if she should take off her hat - just like little Jordyn. 'By the end of the show the kids are all cheering for her to take off her hat,' Mr Nunn explains. 'Once our puppet show had come to one school, we heard of a girl who went back to her class and quietly removed her hat and she didn't wear it from then on. Once we teach the students about it, that child becomes a sort of hero for all they've been through and they have other children falling over themselves to be their friend.' After Mrs Miller asked Camp Quality to come to her daughter's school to perform their puppet show, she said there was an instant change in attitude. Now, whilst her hair is still much shorter than it once was, Jordyn - who is now in remission - often tells her mother how much she's looking forward to having long hair again.\n\nSummary:", params:

Please output the summary only, without any other text.\n\nArticle:\nMassimo Cellino, the former Leeds United president, will not return to the club until the end of the season. The Football League had disqualified him from running the Championship club until April 10 in January. He decided to step away from the club last month in order to clear his name. However, the Football League have now said that they have'settled the outstanding disciplinary proceedings' against Cellino and the club and he can return from May 3. Leeds United owner Massimo Cellino  will be allowed to return to the club at the end of the season. Cellino was disqualified in January after the the non-disclosure of a tax evasion charge against him in Italy. A league statement read: 'The Football League, Leeds United and Massimo Cellino have settled the outstanding disciplinary proceedings relating to the club's non-disclosure of the Italian Court's judgment regarding Mr Cellino, as required under League regulations. 'The club and Mr Cellino have decided in the interests of the club, its players and supporters not to contest this charge. As a result, Mr Cellino's period of disqualification as a'relevant person', as defined by the regulations, has now been extended from April 10 until May 3, the day after the conclusion of the 2014/15 league season. Alex Mowatt (left) celebrates after scoring in Leeds 2-1 victory over Ipswich on Wednesday. 'Mr Cellino's right to challenge the decision of the Professional Conduct Committee under Football Association Rule K is unaffected by this settlement.'Cellino, who took over Leeds towards the end of last season, has decided to independently appeal his Football League disqualification which was initially due to expire on April 10. Cellino recently sold his personal stake in Eleonora Sport - the company he set up to buy Leeds a year ago - and said he would not be returning to the club while he tries to clear his name, giving rise to speculation he could be about to sell up. The Football \xa0League has announced it has settled 'disciplinary proceedings' with the Italian businessman. Andrew Umbers, who stepped in as chairman when Cellino's ban began, insists Cellino does not want to sell and that there have not been any approaches, despite interest from Hollywood film star Russell Crowe, a long-standing Leeds fan who asked his Twitter followers if taking over the club would be a good idea and got an overwhelmingly positive response. Leeds' fortunes on the pitch have certainly not been affected by the ownership uncertainty with the 2-1 win over Ipswich at Elland Road on Wednesday night their sixth in nine games, a run which has lifted them clear of the relegation zone and into 15th place.\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=128, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=False, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: [128000, 9370, 5730, 553, 279, 2768, 3754, 4652, 304, 220, 4386, 11460, 13, 5321, 2612, 279, 12399, 1193, 11, 2085, 904, 1023, 1495, 382, 17064, 512, 26909, 11620, 14299, 3394, 11, 279, 4846, 52629, 3723, 4872, 11, 690, 539, 471, 311, 279, 6469, 3156, 279, 842, 315, 279, 3280, 13, 578, 21424, 9130, 1047, 94676, 1461, 505, 4401, 279, 19134, 6469, 3156, 5936, 220, 605, 304, 6186, 13, 1283, 6773, 311, 3094, 3201, 505, 279, 6469, 1566, 2305, 304, 2015, 311, 2867, 813, 836, 13, 4452, 11, 279, 21424, 9130, 617, 1457, 1071, 430, 814, 617, 596, 7211, 839, 279, 19310, 57315, 29407, 6, 2403, 14299, 3394, 323, 279, 6469, 323, 568, 649, 471, 505, 3297, 220, 18, 13, 52629, 3723, 6506, 9346, 11620, 14299, 3394, 220, 690, 387, 5535, 311, 471, 311, 279, 6469, 520, 279, 842, 315, 279, 3280, 13, 14299, 3394, 574, 94676, 304, 6186, 1306, 279, 279, 2536, 52765, 11915, 315, 264, 3827, 77832, 6900, 2403, 1461, 304, 15704, 13, 362, 10966, 5224, 1373, 25, 364, 791, 21424, 9130, 11, 52629, 3723, 323, 9346, 11620, 14299, 3394, 617, 23183, 279, 19310, 57315, 29407, 23343, 311, 279, 6469, 596, 2536, 52765, 11915, 315, 279, 15155, 7301, 596, 19971, 9002, 4491, 14299, 3394, 11, 439, 2631, 1234, 9130, 14640, 13, 364, 791, 6469, 323, 4491, 14299, 3394, 617, 6773, 304, 279, 12034, 315, 279, 6469, 11, 1202, 4311, 323, 15879, 539, 311, 14130, 420, 6900, 13, 1666, 264, 1121, 11, 4491, 14299, 3394, 596, 4261, 315, 834, 73009, 439, 264, 2351, 8532, 1732, 518, 439, 4613, 555, 279, 14640, 11, 706, 1457, 1027, 11838, 505, 5936, 220, 605, 3156, 3297, 220, 18, 11, 279, 1938, 1306, 279, 17102, 315, 279, 220, 679, 19, 14, 868, 10966, 3280, 13, 8683, 386, 363, 1617, 320, 2414, 8, 49193, 1306, 20413, 304, 52629, 220, 17, 12, 16, 12845, 927, 90062, 17316, 389, 8079, 13, 364, 12555, 14299, 3394, 596, 1314, 311, 8815, 279, 5597, 315, 279, 21931, 50935, 10554, 1234, 21424, 10229, 18592, 735, 374, 78622, 555, 420, 17516, 3238, 3683, 3394, 11, 889, 3952, 927, 52629, 7119, 279, 842, 315, 1566, 3280, 11, 706, 6773, 311, 29235, 14638, 813, 21424, 9130, 834, 73009, 902, 574, 15453, 4245, 311, 33663, 389, 5936, 220, 605, 13, 14299, 3394, 6051, 6216, 813, 4443, 18783, 304, 27039, 263, 6347, 18707, 482, 279, 2883, 568, 743, 709, 311, 3780, 52629, 264, 1060, 4227, 482, 323, 1071, 568, 1053, 539, 387, 13758, 311, 279, 6469, 1418, 568, 16696, 311, 2867, 813, 836, 11, 7231, 10205, 311, 33422, 568, 1436, 387, 922, 311, 4662, 709, 13, 578, 21424, 220, 4194, 71207, 706, 7376, 433, 706, 23183, 364, 71200, 29407, 6, 449, 279, 15155, 47378, 13, 13929, 24218, 1941, 11, 889, 25319, 304, 439, 21892, 994, 14299, 3394, 596, 9120, 6137, 11, 43446, 14299, 3394, 1587, 539, 1390, 311, 4662, 323, 430, 1070, 617, 539, 1027, 904, 20414, 11, 8994, 2802, 505, 17681, 4632, 6917, 25953, 27991, 68, 11, 264, 1317, 56703, 52629, 8571, 889, 4691, 813, 6405, 20723, 422, 4737, 927, 279, 6469, 1053, 387, 264, 1695, 4623, 323, 2751, 459, 55734, 6928, 2077, 13, 52629, 6, 68603, 389, 279, 9846, 617, 7995, 539, 1027, 11754, 555, 279, 15637, 27924, 449, 279, 220, 17, 12, 16, 3243, 927, 90062, 17316, 520, 13852, 438, 9728, 389, 8079, 3814, 872, 26084, 304, 11888, 3953, 11, 264, 1629, 902, 706, 30831, 1124, 2867, 315, 279, 59782, 367, 10353, 323, 1139, 220, 868, 339, 2035, 382, 19791, 25], prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

Please output the summary only, without any other text.\n\nArticle:\nA 28-year-old blind woman has had her confidence shattered after a bus driver laughed in her face and refused to believe she qualified for a disabled fare. Megan Johnston, from Newtown, Wellington, in New Zealand, has a degenerative eye disease that has left her with just five per cent vision. Megan uses a walking cane to assist her in getting around with her extreme tunnel vision and when she boarded the bus on Wednesday afternoon she had folded the stick under her arm. ‘When the bus pulled up I went to get on after a few people and, like I usually do, I folded up my cane and showed the driver my card,’ Megan told Daily Mail Australia. Megan Johnston, from Wellington, in New Zealand, was shocked when a bus driver refused to believe she was blind despite showing him her concessions bus pass and cane. The bus pass, issued by NZ Bus, clearly states ‘blind person’ on it. ‘It just gets me a dollar off my fare which I thought I may as well use,’ Megan said. As she handed over her $2 fare the driver refused to take her money as she explained the pass simply gets her a concession fare. ‘He said “yeah but you are not blind are you?” and started laughing,’ Megan said. ‘I said “are you kidding me” and he said “well how did you get on the bus, you can obviously see things”,’ she recalled. Megan’s hereditary condition, Retinitis Pigmentosa, means her eyesight is approximately 170 degrees worse than a person with perfect eyesight and leaves her with no peripheral vision. Shocked by his assumption that she was lying about being blind, Megan told the bus driver she has ‘five per cent vision’ and he responded: ‘That’s not actually blind is it.’ Megan's bus pass, issued by NZ Bus, clearly states 'blind person' on it but the driver simply laughed at her. The 28-year-old has a degenerative eye disease that has left her with just five per cent vision. ‘I was really shocked. I took my money and got off the bus… I should be able to get on the bus without being questioned,’ Megan said. ‘I was just devastated. I was on my way into town to meet a friend and it’s taken a long time for me to be confident using my cane and be not judged.’ Upset and in tears, Megan fired off a message on Twitter to the bus company and was told to call their generic customer service line. ‘I said “hey your bus driver just laughed at me and said I wasn’t blind despite having a cane and a card”. They gave me the general Metlink number.’ When Megan rang the company in tears she was told they would get back to her in two to three weeks. Since her story was first published in the Dominion Post, the Go Wellington bus company has been in touch to apologise. Megan, a talented artist who drew the above illustration of herself, uses a walking cane to assist her in getting around with her extreme tunnel vision. Retinitis Pigmentosa is an inherited, degenerative eye disease that causes severe vision impairment and often blindness. It dramatically effects peripheral vision and is often described as extreme tunnel vision. The degeneration is progressive and has no known cure. But Megan believes there needs to be more awareness around the fact there are varying degrees of blindness. ‘I am constantly confronted by people who think blindness is black and white. But there is a big variation,’ Megan explained. Megan has had her cane for around a year and a half and it isn’t known at what rate, or if, her eyesight will continue to deteriorate. ‘I haven’t been on a bus since then and I definitely don’t feel comfortable. I also have a card for half price taxi fares so I feel more comfortable using that now,’ she said. Since becoming legally blind Megan, a talented artist and designer, has battled with not only her difficulty in seeing what’s around her but also people’s perceptions of her disability. ‘I’ve always had artistic tendencies but people find it hard to deal with because it’s such a visual thing. It took her a long time before she began feeling confident enough to use her cane (pictured) in public. ‘The fact of the matter is I do have intact middle vision and it’s there and fine and it’s more than I need to draw illustrations. It also means I can work from home and don’t have to go out,’ she said. Megan inherited her Retinitis Pigmentosa, which cannot be cured, from her father and is considered legally blind. In an article she wrote for the website On The Left,\xa0Megan described how ‘getting around in public became increasingly hard a few years ago’. ‘I was constantly getting in people’s way. People were in a hurry and were huffing and puffing and occasionally swearing at me. They weren’t to know, but it made me feel horrible. If I bumped into just one person, it would rattle me and ruin my entire day,’ she wrote. The illustrator reasoned: ‘Blindness comes in many, many forms and just because we can’t see one thing, it doesn’t mean we can’t see another.’\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1,

The 21-year-old jockey rides Egyptian War, trained by his father Aidan and owned by JP McManus, in the Family Fun Day Rated Novices’ Hurdle,. At the same time, the mounts on seven runners also trained by his father at The Curragh are shared between Ryan Moore and Joseph’s apprentice jockey younger siblings Ana and Donnacha. O’Brien, who is almost six feet tall, has admitted his time riding on the Flat is likely to be limited by weight issues. Joseph O'Brien poses with the Gold Cup after winning the race at Ascot last year. This latest news will increase speculation that the switch of codes is near at hand. In a statement, his father said: ‘Joseph is a little heavy at the moment but plans to be back riding on the Flat shortly. He has his first ride over hurdles on Egyptian Warrior at Limerick on Sunday after which he will travel to the Curragh to ride work after racing.’ Joseph, winner of two of the last three Derbies on Australia and Camelot, has a string of big race mounts potentially lined up for him with Gleneagles favourite for the 2,000 Guineas and JF Kennedy currently front runner of clutch of Derby possibles. Should Joseph have to turn his back permanently on the Flat, Moore, the three-time British champion, would be favourite to take more rides for his father’s stable. Teaforthree, the Rebecca Curtis-trained Grand National third in 2013 who got as far as The Chair last year when joint favourite last year, is out of next month’ s race. Teaforthree clears the last fence on the way to victory at Bangor-on-Dee racecourse last month.\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=128, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=False, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: [128000, 9370, 5730, 553, 279, 2768, 3754, 4652, 304, 220, 4386, 11460, 13, 5321, 2612, 279, 12399, 1193, 11, 2085, 904, 1023, 1495, 382, 17064, 512, 61760, 507, 62561, 706, 29676, 568, 690, 2103, 387, 20427, 389, 279, 24492, 420, 3280, 8994, 20427, 927, 73635, 369, 279, 1176, 892, 520, 445, 3212, 875, 389, 7884, 13, 578, 220, 1691, 4771, 6418, 503, 18369, 32327, 33589, 5111, 11, 16572, 555, 813, 7126, 38505, 276, 323, 13234, 555, 49880, 4584, 1692, 355, 11, 304, 279, 12517, 16457, 6187, 38560, 4723, 1238, 529, 473, 16468, 273, 17974, 2468, 279, 1890, 892, 11, 279, 57322, 389, 8254, 39380, 1101, 16572, 555, 813, 7126, 520, 578, 13182, 4193, 71, 527, 6222, 1990, 13960, 20832, 323, 15466, 753, 83299, 503, 18369, 14992, 37783, 33238, 323, 4418, 77, 52676, 13, 507, 93126, 11, 889, 374, 4661, 4848, 7693, 16615, 11, 706, 16584, 813, 892, 20427, 389, 279, 24492, 374, 4461, 311, 387, 7347, 555, 4785, 4819, 13, 15466, 507, 62561, 34103, 449, 279, 7573, 11098, 1306, 11230, 279, 7102, 520, 40660, 354, 1566, 1060, 13, 1115, 5652, 3754, 690, 5376, 33422, 430, 279, 3480, 315, 14236, 374, 3221, 520, 1450, 13, 763, 264, 5224, 11, 813, 7126, 1071, 25, 3451, 61760, 374, 264, 2697, 8987, 520, 279, 4545, 719, 6787, 311, 387, 1203, 20427, 389, 279, 24492, 20193, 13, 1283, 706, 813, 1176, 12141, 927, 73635, 389, 33589, 40322, 520, 445, 3212, 875, 389, 7418, 1306, 902, 568, 690, 5944, 311, 279, 13182, 4193, 71, 311, 12141, 990, 1306, 22019, 14639, 15466, 11, 13946, 315, 1403, 315, 279, 1566, 2380, 13031, 57773, 389, 8494, 323, 69254, 354, 11, 706, 264, 925, 315, 2466, 7102, 57322, 13893, 32393, 709, 369, 1461, 449, 8444, 1994, 351, 645, 19214, 369, 279, 220, 17, 11, 931, 4673, 483, 300, 323, 622, 37, 24573, 5131, 4156, 23055, 315, 43789, 315, 46873, 2278, 21041, 13, 12540, 15466, 617, 311, 2543, 813, 1203, 31859, 389, 279, 24492, 11, 20832, 11, 279, 2380, 7394, 8013, 18824, 11, 1053, 387, 19214, 311, 1935, 810, 32327, 369, 813, 7126, 753, 15528, 13, 31125, 2000, 28956, 11, 279, 45557, 51816, 70024, 10517, 5165, 4948, 304, 220, 679, 18, 889, 2751, 439, 3117, 439, 578, 16478, 1566, 1060, 994, 10496, 19214, 1566, 1060, 11, 374, 704, 315, 1828, 2305, 529, 274, 7102, 13, 31125, 2000, 28956, 57698, 279, 1566, 25675, 389, 279, 1648, 311, 12845, 520, 17343, 269, 10539, 12, 1951, 68, 7102, 12120, 1566, 2305, 382, 19791, 25], prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

But Martin Dolan, Chief Commissioner of the Australian Transport Safety Bureau, says that as search teams scour the depths of the Indian Ocean for any sign of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370, he is confident they will find the plane, if the aircraft is in the areas where they are looking. "If anything, I\'m slightly more optimistic than six months ago, because we have more confidence in the data, and we have proven the search equipment and techniques work to the necessary standards," Dolan said. But as the first anniversary of MH370\'s disappearance approaches, with no trace of the missing plane found, not everyone shares his outlook. That includes many of the relatives of the 239 passengers and crew on board, who say not a single day goes by without wondering what happened to their loved ones. And for many, the decision in late January by Malaysia to officially declare MH370 an accident, enabling the insurance payout process to begin in accordance with international protocol, was painfully premature. "How can they say that, when there is no proof that the plane has crashed?" asked Wen Wang Cheng, whose son Wen Yung Sheng was one of 153 Chinese nationals on board.  "We have to get the facts," Wen said. What families have been told, they say, simply isn\'t good enough.  Anger, frustration, and distrust pushed some relatives, including Wen, to fly from China to Kuala Lumpur last month, to demand more. But when families submitted a letter to Malaysia Airlines asking for authorities to explain the declaration and status of the investigation, a written response from the company\'s CEO revealed little that hadn\'t already been said. At 12:41 a.m. local time on March 8, 2014, Malaysia Airlines MH370 took off from Kuala Lumpur International Airport, en route to Beijing. Less than an hour later, the Boeing 777-200ER was flying over the South China Sea. Air traffic controllers in Malaysia radioed the crew to contact controllers in Ho Chi Minh City for its onward journey through Vietnamese airspace. The crew acknowledged the request, thanking Kuala Lumpur controllers with a routine reply: "Good night, Malaysian Three-Seven-Zero."  Minutes later, the plane disappeared from radar. Malaysian authorities revealed days later that military radar had tracked the plane as it turned back to the west, flew across the Malay Peninsula, and up the Strait of Malacca, before flying out of radar range and vanishing once again. The search area widened, then shifted off the coast of Western Australia, when it was determined through careful analysis of a series of messages or "handshakes" between the plane and an Inmarsat telecommunications satellite, that MH370 eventually turned south, and flew for hours into the Indian Ocean. Roughly a week\'s sail from the coast of Western Australia, ships with specialists and equipment capable of searching depths that regularly exceed 4,000 meters (13,123 feet), work around the clock, methodically ticking off sections of sea floor. In early February a new ship, the Fugro Supporter, joined the search carrying the HUGIN 4500, a programmable unmanned submarine, now scanning areas that other equipment couldn\'t safely cover, including steep mountain slopes. The ship joins the Discovery and Fugro Equator, both operated by a Dutch survey firm, along with the Malaysian-contracted GO Phoenix. "I asked specifically to come on this job, because it\'s a very exciting opportunity to do something that will potentially help a lot of people," James Hancock, a surveyor who usually works in the oil industry in the North Sea, told CNN\'s Anna Coren, as he prepared to embark on a trip on the Fugro Discovery that could last up to six weeks. Since October, more than 24,000 square kilometers -- roughly 40% of what the ATSB calls the "priority search area" -- has been scanned, with the remainder of the work scheduled to be finished by May before weather conditions worsen as the southern winter approaches. For now, teams are searching mostly using devices called towfish, which are dragged close to the ocean floor on cables up to 10 kilometers long. It\'s tough work, even when conditions are perfect.  A number of cyclones, producing waves of up to 16 meters, put the brakes on the search in early February. Dolan is careful to point out search efforts are meeting or exceeding expectations, dismissing concerns over stormy weather or delays in installing equipment as "part of the deal." The current search area is the result of months of analysis and reexamination of satellite data by an international team of experts, combined with aircraft performance factors such as fuel range, speed, and altitude. Search ships are focused along the so-called 7th arc, or "partial handshake," where international investigators believe the plane ran out of fuel. "The thing that really impresses me most about this investigation was how much information we were able to gain through mathematics and science," said CNN Safety Analyst David Soucie. But Soucie, a former FAA accident investigator, is not optimistic that the deep-sea search teams will find what they\'re looking for.  "I know that they\'ve searched in the most probable areas where it would have been, and it\'s not there," he said. Jeff Wise, a science journalist and author of "The Plane That Wasn\'t There," took that skepticism a step further, saying it\'s time to reexamine all the clues.  His latest theory contends that investigators may have misinterpreted a key component of the Inmarsat satellite data, and that MH370 may have instead flown north toward Kazakhstan. "This is not a normal investigation.  They need to throw out the book," said Wise. "This is unlike anything that\'s happened in aviation." But Michael Exner, an engineer with decades of experience in the mobile satellite communications industry, says the data "accurately and unambiguously" shows MH370 went down near the 7th arc. "The current ATSB search strategy remains the best search strategy," Exner said. "They are looking exactly where I expect the plane to be found." The ATSB\'s Dolan cautioned that search teams have placed equal priority on all areas within the 60,000 square kilometer search zone.  "We haven\'t given up.  Quite the opposite," he said. If search teams succeed in locating the wreckage of MH370, Australia, which has been leading the search at Malaysia\'s request, will also lead salvage and recovery efforts, according to the ATSB Chief Commissioner. But Malaysia, Australia, and China, which had the majority of the passengers on board the flight, have not yet made a decision on whether a recovery will occur, Dolan said. It is unclear what will happen if search teams complete their current mission without finding any sign of the plane. Australia has allocated roughly $48 million to the current phase of the search, with Malaysia promising to contribute equally to the cost.  In January, the Malaysian government said it is committed "to continue all reasonable efforts to bring closure to this unfortunate tragedy." One possibility is that the deep-sea search could be extended outside the boundaries of the current priority area, north or south along the 7th arc. The ATSB would not comment on the likelihood of expanding the search, saying that it was a "decision for governments." Malaysia also plans to release an interim statement detailing the progress of the investigation into MH370 around March 8 -- though some experts believe it will not contain any information investigators do not already have. Aviation experts say there is a key reason the search should continue until MH370 is found. "Without knowing what caused it, you can\'t fix it, you can\'t make sure it doesn\'t happen again," said Soucie.  "And I think that\'s really the biggest tragedy of this, if they don\'t find the airplane." For the families of the 239 passengers and crew on board, who have had nothing but hope and prayers to carry them through the past year, it\'s about finding answers. "It\'s very difficult to hear the world closure, when there is no closure," Jacquita Gonzales, the wife of lead steward Patrick Gomes, told CNN\'s Andrew Stevens. And while Gonzales says she holds out hope her husband could return home alive, she is prepared for a difficult discovery. "If it\'s there and there\'s debris, we can have closure and we can lay him at peace. Because I don\'t think he\'s at peace right now." The search for MH370 continues. CNN\'s Andrew Stevens, Anna Coren, Tim Schwarz, Felicia Wong, Chieu Luu, and Judy Kwon contributed to this report.\n\nSummary:', params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0,

Please output the summary only, without any other text.\n\nArticle:\nIt seems while Chinese men are earning more money, they're also losing more hair. A quarter of Chinese males are going bald, according to the\xa0People's Daily. If their bald patches were combined together, the size would cover 4,725 square kilometres which is roughly a quarter of Beijing or three times the size of London. Hair-rising fact: A quarter of the 800 million men in China are getting bald or are already bald, expert says. The new survey, which interviewed 5,779 men from five Chinese cities, including Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou revealed that 25 per cent of men are losing their hair. The balding rate among men in China is increasing and the phenomenon is appearing in younger crowds, wrote the People's Daily. The thinning trend shows more men are losing their hair compared with a previous survey in 2005. The state-run media also suggested that young and middle-aged men form the majority of China's 'army of balds'. The same survey also revealed that 95 per cent of Chinese men with the issue don't seek conventional medical treatments – instead they prefer other ways of treatment such as folk or secret prescriptions. Lu Jun, the Deputy Secretary of Chinese Medical Doctor Association, said there are approximately 200 million bald and balding males in China. The survey was conducted after Li Yapeng, a popular actor in China and a former heartthrob, was photographed drinking soup in a restaurant with a balding head. Analysis: Chinese media attribute the phenomenon to a mix of causes, including stress and irregular lifestyle.\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=128, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=False, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: [128000, 9370, 5730, 553, 279, 2768, 3754, 4652, 304, 220, 4386, 11460, 13, 5321, 2612, 279, 12399, 1193, 11, 2085, 904, 1023, 1495, 382, 17064, 512, 2181, 5084, 1418, 8620, 3026, 527, 28744, 810, 3300, 11, 814, 2351, 1101, 13490, 810, 7013, 13, 362, 8502, 315, 8620, 25000, 527, 2133, 48653, 11, 4184, 311, 279, 4194, 16298, 596, 13690, 13, 1442, 872, 48653, 29760, 1051, 11093, 3871, 11, 279, 1404, 1053, 3504, 220, 19, 11, 23309, 9518, 52957, 902, 374, 17715, 264, 8502, 315, 27647, 477, 2380, 3115, 279, 1404, 315, 7295, 13, 26781, 3880, 3876, 2144, 25, 362, 8502, 315, 279, 220, 4728, 3610, 3026, 304, 5734, 527, 3794, 48653, 477, 527, 2736, 48653, 11, 6335, 2795, 13, 578, 502, 10795, 11, 902, 30147, 220, 20, 11, 25659, 3026, 505, 4330, 8620, 9919, 11, 2737, 27647, 11, 38147, 323, 65537, 52865, 10675, 430, 220, 914, 824, 2960, 315, 3026, 527, 13490, 872, 7013, 13, 578, 48653, 287, 4478, 4315, 3026, 304, 5734, 374, 7859, 323, 279, 25885, 374, 26449, 304, 14992, 35851, 11, 6267, 279, 9029, 596, 13690, 13, 578, 15792, 1251, 9327, 5039, 810, 3026, 527, 13490, 872, 7013, 7863, 449, 264, 3766, 10795, 304, 220, 1049, 20, 13, 578, 1614, 23831, 3772, 1101, 12090, 430, 3995, 323, 6278, 57859, 3026, 1376, 279, 8857, 315, 5734, 596, 364, 2227, 88, 315, 48653, 82, 4527, 578, 1890, 10795, 1101, 10675, 430, 220, 2721, 824, 2960, 315, 8620, 3026, 449, 279, 4360, 1541, 956, 6056, 21349, 6593, 22972, 1389, 4619, 814, 10932, 1023, 5627, 315, 6514, 1778, 439, 29036, 477, 6367, 65835, 13, 18866, 12044, 11, 279, 32724, 12667, 315, 8620, 13235, 19150, 10229, 11, 1071, 1070, 527, 13489, 220, 1049, 3610, 48653, 323, 48653, 287, 25000, 304, 5734, 13, 578, 10795, 574, 13375, 1306, 14851, 107341, 833, 11, 264, 5526, 12360, 304, 5734, 323, 264, 4846, 4851, 339, 23576, 11, 574, 57303, 16558, 19724, 304, 264, 10960, 449, 264, 48653, 287, 2010, 13, 18825, 25, 8620, 3772, 7180, 279, 25885, 311, 264, 6651, 315, 11384, 11, 2737, 8631, 323, 42408, 19433, 382, 19791, 25], prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

According to a press conference on Tuesday given by Vallejo police officers, Denise Huskins was forcibly abducted against her will from her boyfriend's home. Her captor or captors also made off with a white Toyota Camry from the home that is registered to her boyfriend. The car was recovered hours afterwards at an undisclosed location miles away from the scene. The car and the home are both registered to Aaron Quinn who neighbors confirmed lives with Huskins in the two-story yellow home on Kirkland Avenue. The Daily Mail Online could not reach him for comment. Police Lt. Kenny Park said that police were first contacted at 1.55pm - hours after her alleged abduction - by her 30-year-old boyfriend who  was in the house at the time of the assault. Park would not comment on why Quinn appeared to wait so long before contacting them and added that the he is not in custody but that he is helping them 'piece the puzzle together.' Scroll down for video. Appeal: Police in Vallejo have asked the public for any help in locating physical therapist Denise Huskins who they believe has been kidnapped and held for ransom. They have issued the picture of her (left) and her Toyota Camry (right) which was recovered away from her home on Monday evening. Arrival: Denise (on the right) moved to Vallejo in June 2014 and began working at Kaiser Hospital and was previously a physical therapist at Southern California Orthopedic Institute. At the press conference Park did not say how the ransom was communicated nor how much is being demanded. Park also said he did not believe the house had been robbed according to the\xa0Sacramento Bee. 'We are concerned for Ms. Huskins' well-being,' said Lt. Kenny Park during the afternoon press conference. 'At this moment, Ms. Huskins' whereabouts are unknown and we are treating this matter as a kidnap for ransom,' 'We have dedicated all our resources, and we are giving it full, undivided attention until we can locate Ms. Huskins and secure her safe return.' Search crews and dogs are combing the marsh lands of nearby Mare Island for Huskins. According to family Huskins works at Kaiser Hospital with her boyfriend and her father said he was stunned by the crime. 'This is overwhelming to me,' said Michael Huskins to CBS. 'I don't understand it. That's the hard part. I just don't understand what's going on.' 'If she sees this, I want her to know, that the family is there, we love her and we're not giving up,' he said. Home: Denise Huskins was taken against her will from her home on Kirkland Avenue (pictured) early on Monday morning. Police described her as 5 feet 7 inches tall, 150 pounds, with blond hair and blue eyes. Suspicion had earlier fallen on a local peeping Tom who lived in the area recently, who had been spotted crawling on people's roofs. He has apparently moved away according to neighbors who spoke to\xa0ABC News. According to her Facebook page, Huskins works at Kaiser Hospital and Vallejo Police Department has called in help from the FBI and the Solano County Offie of Emergency Services. Officers released pictures of Huskins' boyfriend's car and asked for anyone who may have seen the vehicle during Monday afternoon or evening to contact them. Desperate search: Police would not say what the ransom was for Denise (left and second right with her mother) nor how they knew she had been abducted. Indeed, according to the San Francisco Chronicle, police have been unusually tight lipped about the incident. Once they received the report about the abduction, the alert was not sent over police radio but rather sent by phone between dispatchers and officers. This suggests her kidnapper is listening into police radio broadcasts. Huskins previously worked at a Southern California orthopedic institute and arrived in Vallejo in June 2014. Anyone with information on this case is asked to contact the Vallejo Police Department at 707-648-4524.\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0,

Please output the summary only, without any other text.\n\nArticle:\nA woman has been left ‘gobsmacked’ after a camera, packed with memories of her once in a lifetime trip to Antarctica, is on its way back to her after she lost it three months ago on a snowy iceberg. Photographer Hulia Boz, from Sydney, was on an impromptu two-week holiday to the remote region costing around $13,000 after being invited along by friends who had a spare place on their trip. She’d loaded her iPad up with episodes of American comedian Ellen DeGeneres’s chat show to entertain her while travelling to Antarctica and had been watching a Robin Williams episode with her fellow travellers in the moments before she lost her camera. Packed around her tiny screen on a remote iceberg, surrounded by nothing but ice, snow, penguins and seals, Ms Boz and her tour group then decided to record a message to Ellen on her white Canon camera. ‘We spent an open night on an iceberg, the only thing around us were penguins and seals lazing around. I took the camera out of my pocket and said “everyone let’s do a very Merry Christmas from Antarctica to Ellen because she’s entertaining us at the bottom of the earth”,’ Ms Boz explained. 'Nothing like a selfie to help identify a lost camera!': This is the distinctive photo that helped tour operator staff identify Hulia Boz from the photos on her lost camera. Moments after recording the festive message on December 12, on day seven of her trip to Earth's southernmost continent, Ms Boz got up to go to the ‘bathroom’. ‘You’ve got to build a wall from ice to go to the toilet. I went to do my wee and the camera must have fallen out of my pocket, I didn’t realise,’ she said. The 34-year-old was unaware that she’d lost her white camera in the snow until she boarded the ship the next day and began unpacking her belongings. ‘The ship started to pull away and I thought “where is the camera? Where is the camera?” and we thought “no we were going to send it to Ellen!”,’ Ms Boz laughed. The story of how Ms Boz is now being reunited with her camera, which was white and camouflaged in the snow, is nothing short of a miracle. Before departing on the ship to Antarctica, Ms Boz and the rest of her tour group had mugshots taken at the port in Ushuaia, Argentina – the southernmost city in the world - where they sailed from. All tourists heading to Antarctica have these photos taken so they can be officially identified if need be. Photographer Hulia Boz, from Sydney, was on an impromptu two-week holiday to Antarctica when she lost her camera. She took the white Canon camera along on her trip so she could capture'silly' photos and used her professional cameras for landscape photography. This picture shows Hulia's friend cosying up with a seal in Antarctica. Her friend took photos on her camera and shared them with Hulia when her camera was lost. She was lucky enough to get a spare place on the trip which cost her around $13,000 after being invited along by friends. Hulia and her fellow tourists were watching an Ellen DeGeneres episode before she lost her camera. A traveller with a different tour company, Quark Expeditions, miraculously found Ms Boz’s camera in the snow on the same iceberg near Useful Island in February and took it back to the port in Ushuaia, where they handed it in. Polar Operations Manager for Aurora travel Tomas Holik was given the camera ‘with no marking nor name on it’ and looked through the pictures stored on it, leading him to figure out that it belonged to Ms Boz as he compared the photos to the mugshots taken from recent expeditions. 'Once they saw all the young faces in the recording they found a voyage that happened to have young people on it.... they then sent my selfie to the ship's team leaders asking if they knew who I was,' Ms Boz explained. ‘By looking at its pictures I figured out that it belongs to a passenger of EAP27,’ Mr Holik wrote in an email to the Sydney-based tour company that Ms Boz travelled with. Before Hulia knew that she would ever be reunited with her lost camera her friend sent her these photos that she had taken of her. The 34-year-old was unaware that she’d lost her white camera in the snow until she boarded the ship the next day and began unpacking her belongings. Amongst the many memories from her two-week trip where plenty of fun selfies taken in the stunning snowy environment. The group were camping out on an iceberg in  Useful Island in December when she lost her camera. Assistant expedition leader Robyn Mundy replied: ‘I am amazed and astonished that someone found the camera. And returned it! We looked for it on the following voyage but there was still too much snow cover to find a white camera.’ ‘It does indeed belong to one of our EAP27 passengers, Hulia Boz. Nothing like a selfie to help identify a lost camera! If you could possibly get it back to Sydney via a staff member or passenger, I’m sure Hulia will be eternally grateful,’ Ms Mundy replied. Ms Boz’s camera, which amazingly still works, is now on its way back to Sydney. ‘When they told me the person’s flight details and the name I thought this is really real. I hadn’t put out a plea on social media because there is nothing there but ice and penguins,' she said. Packed around her tiny screen on a remote iceberg, surrounded by nothing but ice, snow, penguins and seals, Ms Boz and her tour group then decided to record a message to Ellen on her white Canon camera. Hulia still intends to send the Christmas message to Ellen once her camera returns to her, even if it is a bit late. This photo shows the ship that the group travelled from Argentina to Antarctica in over four days. Hulia has called the trip and the surprise of someone finding her camera in the remote snow 'the most over whelming experience of my life' 'The effort, patience and goodwill that was put into reuniting me with my memories by strangers has amazed me. It has restored my faith in humanity. 'My camera was identified as my property by a selfie I had taken and the footage my friends and I had taken to send to Ellen DeGeneres as that was the last thing on the camera. 'I am one lucky person who is grateful and overwhelmed by this all. Miracles do happen. Even if Antarctica is twice as big as Australia. Even with no permanent residence. Even if the colour of my camera was white and would be difficult to detect on ice,' she said happily. 'This truly was and probably will be the most over whelming experience of my life. I met some amazing talented people who I shared some very special memories with, built friendships for life, did some crazy things and most of all have one amazing story to tell my grand kids one day.'\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[],

The suspect, who is described as  between 20 and 30-years-old, is accused of attacking the 16-year-old brothers with a'very sharp blade' following a party in Dilton Marsh, near Westbury in Wiltshire, last night. One of the boys remains in a serious but stable condition in Southmead Hospital in Bristol after the knife slashed his chest, only narrowly missing his heart. The suspect, who is described as between 20 and 30-years-old, is accused of attacking the 16-year-old twin brothers with a'very sharp blade' at a roundabout in Dilton Marsh, near Westbury in Wiltshire (pictured) The other teenager suffered cuts to his hands and has since been discharged from hospital. Detective Inspector Paul Franklin, of Wiltshire Police, said the suspect approached the twins, who were part of a group which had gathered at a roundabout in the village following a party, before threatening them. Some members of the group then chased the attacker, who police believe was unknown to the teenagers. Mr Franklin said: 'We've been\xa0told that an unknown man approached the group on the roundabout and threatened them. 'He was chased by several of the teenagers but produced a knife. 'One of the brothers was slashed across the chest and is lucky to be alive because the knife wound was so deep it was close to his heart. He was just a couple of millimetres from death. 'The other brother received cuts to his hands and was treated in hospital in Trowbridge and discharged. 'This was an extremely serious assault with a very sharp blade.' The twins were among a group of young people who had gathered at the Dilton Marsh roundabout following a party in the village. A footpath along the main road near the roundabout was sealed off today as officers continued to search for the knife used in the assault. One of the teenage boys remains in a serious but stable condition following the attack in the rural village (pictured) last night. Police are hunting the knifeman and believe he may have suffered facial injuries. Police said the suspect fled the scene following the attack and remains at large. He is described as being 5ft 8in to 5ft 9in tall, with'shortish' black hair, and was wearing a blue jacket and either blue jeans or grey jogging bottoms. Officers believe it was likely that he was bleeding from a facial injury which he suffered during the fight and urged any witnesses to come forward. Mr Franklin said: 'I urgently need to hear from anyone who was at the party or who witnessed what happened around Tanyard Way between 11pm and midnight on Saturday.' Anyone with information should contact police on 101.\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=128, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=False, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: [128000, 9370, 5730, 553, 279, 2768, 3754, 4652, 304, 220, 4386, 11460, 13, 5321, 2612, 279, 12399, 1193, 11, 2085, 904, 1023, 1495, 382, 17064, 512, 32, 893, 889, 19755, 51280, 34268, 44736, 9564, 832, 2846, 484, 86366, 417, 505, 4648, 6, 374, 1694, 80269, 555, 4379, 3432, 13, 578, 15562, 11, 889, 374, 7633, 439, 220, 1990, 220, 508, 323, 220, 966, 57188, 6418, 11, 374, 13487, 315, 23664, 279, 220, 845, 4771, 6418, 20820, 449, 264, 3077, 894, 17676, 25879, 6, 2768, 264, 4717, 304, 423, 16695, 40163, 11, 3221, 4410, 20176, 304, 468, 3036, 15255, 11, 1566, 3814, 13, 3861, 315, 279, 13305, 8625, 304, 264, 6129, 719, 15528, 3044, 304, 4987, 2727, 329, 15429, 304, 45039, 1306, 279, 22145, 84624, 813, 15489, 11, 1193, 65047, 7554, 813, 4851, 13, 578, 15562, 11, 889, 374, 7633, 439, 1990, 220, 508, 323, 220, 966, 57188, 6418, 11, 374, 13487, 315, 23664, 279, 220, 845, 4771, 6418, 28497, 20820, 449, 264, 3077, 894, 17676, 25879, 6, 520, 264, 4883, 9274, 304, 423, 16695, 40163, 11, 3221, 4410, 20176, 304, 468, 3036, 15255, 320, 69389, 8, 578, 1023, 32639, 16654, 15455, 311, 813, 6206, 323, 706, 2533, 1027, 57191, 505, 8952, 13, 56379, 45595, 7043, 19372, 11, 315, 468, 3036, 15255, 10289, 11, 1071, 279, 15562, 25735, 279, 44736, 11, 889, 1051, 961, 315, 264, 1912, 902, 1047, 20802, 520, 264, 4883, 9274, 304, 279, 14458, 2768, 264, 4717, 11, 1603, 27903, 1124, 13, 4427, 3697, 315, 279, 1912, 1243, 62920, 279, 31810, 11, 889, 4379, 4510, 574, 9987, 311, 279, 37719, 13, 4491, 19372, 1071, 25, 364, 1687, 3077, 1027, 108135, 820, 430, 459, 9987, 893, 25735, 279, 1912, 389, 279, 4883, 9274, 323, 21699, 1124, 13, 364, 1548, 574, 62920, 555, 3892, 315, 279, 37719, 719, 9124, 264, 22145, 13, 364, 4054, 315, 279, 20820, 574, 84624, 4028, 279, 15489, 323, 374, 18069, 311, 387, 13989, 1606, 279, 22145, 27653, 574, 779, 5655, 433, 574, 3345, 311, 813, 4851, 13, 1283, 574, 1120, 264, 5743, 315, 2606, 86366, 417, 505, 4648, 13, 364, 791, 1023, 10868, 4036, 15455, 311, 813, 6206, 323, 574, 12020, 304, 8952, 304, 350, 654, 14024, 323, 57191, 13, 364, 2028, 574, 459, 9193, 6129, 11965, 449, 264, 1633, 17676, 25879, 3238, 578, 44736, 1051, 4315, 264, 1912, 315, 3995, 1274, 889, 1047, 20802, 520, 279, 423, 16695, 40163, 4883, 9274, 2768, 264, 4717, 304, 279, 14458, 13, 362, 4579, 2398, 3235, 279, 1925, 5754, 3221, 279, 4883, 9274, 574, 19584, 1022, 3432, 439, 9808, 8738, 311, 2778, 369, 279, 22145, 1511, 304, 279, 11965, 13, 3861, 315, 279, 34268, 13305, 8625, 304, 264, 6129, 719, 15528, 3044, 2768, 279, 3440, 304, 279, 19624, 14458, 320, 69389, 8, 1566, 3814, 13, 10289, 527, 23330, 279, 1168, 333, 16357, 323, 4510, 568, 1253, 617, 16654, 28900, 15319, 13, 10289, 1071, 279, 15562, 30010, 279, 6237, 2768, 279, 3440, 323, 8625, 520, 3544, 13, 1283, 374, 7633, 439, 1694, 220, 20, 728, 220, 23, 258, 311, 220, 20, 728, 220, 24, 258, 16615, 11, 449, 596, 22780, 819, 6, 3776, 7013, 11, 323, 574, 12512, 264, 6437, 27300, 323, 3060, 6437, 34389, 477, 20366, 99738, 93650, 13, 49947, 4510, 433, 574, 4461, 430, 568, 574, 35763, 505, 264, 28900, 11134, 902, 568, 16654, 2391, 279, 4465, 323, 28932, 904, 28823, 311, 2586, 4741, 13, 4491, 19372, 1071, 25, 364, 40, 77720, 1205, 311, 6865, 505, 5606, 889, 574, 520, 279, 4717, 477, 889, 32126, 1148, 7077, 2212, 350, 3852, 569, 12424, 1990, 220, 806, 5298, 323, 33433, 389, 7884, 3238, 33634, 449, 2038, 1288, 3729, 4379, 389, 220, 4645, 382, 19791, 25], prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

Please output the summary only, without any other text.\n\nArticle:\nTwo Vietnamese citizens and a Canadian have been charged over roles in hacking email service providers in the United States in one of the largest reported data breaches in the nation's history, the Department of Justice said on Friday. Viet Quoc Nguyen, 28, is charged with hacking at least eight email service providers between February 2009 and June 2012 and obtaining more than one billion email addresses. The service providers involved were not named. According to the allegations, Nguyen and fellow Vietnamese citizen Giang Hoang Vu, 25, used the data to send so-called spam to tens of millions of people directing them to products they were selling online. Hacked: The data breach compromised almost one billion email addresses across the United States from February 2009 to June 2012. Both men resided in the Netherlands. Vu, who was extradited to the United States in March of last year, pleaded guilty on Thursday to conspiracy to commit computer fraud. Nguyen remains at large. The other defendant, Canadian David-Manuel Santos Da Silva, 33, was charged with conspiracy to commit money laundering. He is the co-owner of a company called 21 Celsius Inc, that allegedly struck up a marketing arrangement with Nguyen and Vu to generate revenue and launder the proceeds, according to the Justice Department. The two men made $2 million from sales on those products over two years. “Those individuals who line their pockets with money gained through deceiving others should know they will not go undetected and will be held accountable,” said Special Agent in Charge Veronica F. Hyman-Pillot of the IRS Criminal Investigation Division. Vu was taken into custody in the Netherlands in 2012 and was extradited to the US at the beginning of March. Arrests: Two men from Vietnam directed spam to Canadian, David-Manuel Santos Da Silva and the three men made more than $2 million. He has pleaded guilty to to conspiracy to commit computer fraud. Da Silva was nabbed by authorities in February at Ft. Lauderdale International Airport trying to leave the country. 'This case reflects the cutting-edge problems posed by today's cybercrime cases, where the hackers didn't target just a single company; they infiltrated most of the country's email distribution firms,' said acting U.S. Attorney John A. Horn. 'And the scope of the intrusion is unnerving, in that the hackers didn't stop after stealing the companies' proprietary data — they then hijacked the companies' own distribution platforms to send out bulk emails and reaped the profits from email traffic directed to specific websites.'\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=128, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=False, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: [128000, 9370, 5730, 553, 279, 2768, 3754, 4652, 304, 220, 4386, 11460, 13, 5321, 2612, 279, 12399, 1193, 11, 2085, 904, 1023, 1495, 382, 17064, 512, 11874, 49577, 10495, 323, 264, 12152, 617, 1027, 11684, 927, 13073, 304, 39238, 2613, 2532, 12850, 304, 279, 3723, 4273, 304, 832, 315, 279, 7928, 5068, 828, 69140, 304, 279, 7140, 596, 3925, 11, 279, 6011, 315, 12007, 1071, 389, 6740, 13, 18203, 3489, 511, 64261, 11, 220, 1591, 11, 374, 11684, 449, 39238, 520, 3325, 8223, 2613, 2532, 12850, 1990, 7552, 220, 1049, 24, 323, 5651, 220, 679, 17, 323, 19546, 810, 1109, 832, 7239, 2613, 14564, 13, 578, 2532, 12850, 6532, 1051, 539, 7086, 13, 10771, 311, 279, 18873, 11, 64261, 323, 12637, 49577, 22618, 118042, 17723, 526, 57702, 11, 220, 914, 11, 1511, 279, 828, 311, 3708, 779, 19434, 26396, 311, 22781, 315, 11990, 315, 1274, 46090, 1124, 311, 3956, 814, 1051, 11486, 2930, 13, 473, 11440, 25, 578, 828, 31471, 44500, 4661, 832, 7239, 2613, 14564, 4028, 279, 3723, 4273, 505, 7552, 220, 1049, 24, 311, 5651, 220, 679, 17, 13, 11995, 3026, 594, 4591, 304, 279, 26746, 13, 57702, 11, 889, 574, 67902, 1639, 311, 279, 3723, 4273, 304, 5587, 315, 1566, 1060, 11, 40001, 16390, 389, 7950, 311, 26359, 311, 5379, 6500, 16515, 13, 64261, 8625, 520, 3544, 13, 578, 1023, 26884, 11, 12152, 6941, 31251, 4088, 48723, 14569, 42141, 11, 220, 1644, 11, 574, 11684, 449, 26359, 311, 5379, 3300, 64402, 13, 1283, 374, 279, 1080, 70909, 315, 264, 2883, 2663, 220, 1691, 62447, 4953, 11, 430, 19755, 17948, 709, 264, 8661, 27204, 449, 64261, 323, 57702, 311, 7068, 13254, 323, 54138, 279, 34555, 11, 4184, 311, 279, 12007, 6011, 13, 578, 1403, 3026, 1903, 400, 17, 3610, 505, 6763, 389, 1884, 3956, 927, 1403, 1667, 13, 1054, 23025, 7931, 889, 1584, 872, 30278, 449, 3300, 18661, 1555, 31952, 2299, 3885, 1288, 1440, 814, 690, 539, 733, 2073, 295, 1599, 323, 690, 387, 5762, 36977, 2476, 1071, 9984, 21372, 304, 37895, 83621, 435, 13, 10320, 1543, 9483, 484, 354, 315, 279, 34483, 33836, 47997, 14829, 13, 57702, 574, 4529, 1139, 25502, 304, 279, 26746, 304, 220, 679, 17, 323, 574, 67902, 1639, 311, 279, 2326, 520, 279, 7314, 315, 5587, 13, 72417, 82, 25, 9220, 3026, 505, 23315, 15910, 26396, 311, 12152, 11, 6941, 31251, 4088, 48723, 14569, 42141, 323, 279, 2380, 3026, 1903, 810, 1109, 400, 17, 3610, 13, 1283, 706, 40001, 16390, 311, 311, 26359, 311, 5379, 6500, 16515, 13, 14569, 42141, 574, 73791, 2788, 555, 11527, 304, 7552, 520, 45479, 13, 78255, 7327, 21348, 4560, 311, 5387, 279, 3224, 13, 364, 2028, 1162, 27053, 279, 14713, 48448, 5435, 37260, 555, 3432, 596, 21516, 85454, 5157, 11, 1405, 279, 41467, 3287, 956, 2218, 1120, 264, 3254, 2883, 26, 814, 43364, 660, 1455, 315, 279, 3224, 596, 2613, 8141, 19339, 2965, 1071, 15718, 549, 815, 13, 18919, 3842, 362, 13, 27206, 13, 364, 3112, 279, 7036, 315, 279, 82146, 374, 17380, 20073, 11, 304, 430, 279, 41467, 3287, 956, 3009, 1306, 39098, 279, 5220, 6, 34333, 828, 2001, 814, 1243, 22130, 11440, 279, 5220, 6, 1866, 8141, 15771, 311, 3708, 704, 20155, 14633, 323, 312, 10395, 279, 22613, 505, 2613, 9629, 15910, 311, 3230, 13335, 22438, 19791, 25], prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

A 13-year-old has now been arrested by police investigating the incident. A 13-year-old boy has been arrested by detectives investigating an attack which left a football fan fighting for his life in hospital. West Midlands Police said officers arrested the youngster on suspicion of assault at an address in Wolverhampton, just before 5am today. The boy is the second person to be arrested by detectives investigating an attack on 44-year-old Watford supporter Nick Cruwys in Wolverhampton on Saturday, after an 18-year-old man was detained yesterday. That man has since been bailed until April 8. Police described the latest arrest as'significant'. Mr Cruwys was tripped and kicked in the head in an unprovoked attack in the street, following Watford's 2-2 draw with Wolves. The father of two, from Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, was attacked in Little's Lane, Wolverhampton, shortly after 5pm as he made his way to the railway station with friends. An online appeal to raise funds to help Mr Cruwys, set up by a Wolves fan, has now raised more than £25,000. After the latest arrest, police directly appealed to anyone involved in the attack to 'do the right thing' and hand themselves in. Detective Inspector Toni Naylor, of West Midlands Police, said: 'We are pleased with how the investigation is progressing and the arrest of a second suspect is significant. 'But this is not the end of our inquiry, it's only the beginning. 'I am now appealing to anyone who was involved in the incident to think about their actions and to do the right thing and contact us or hand themselves in to a local police station. 'We will leave no stone unturned to find the people involved and by coming forward you will be in a position to give your side of the story.' CCTV from outside the football stadium shows the victim laying stricken on the ground after the attack.

John Cousins, 46, a divorced father of two who lives near Southampton, came up with a novel way to help surgeons during his operation, as he tells Angela Epstein. John Cousins (pictured) did not realise he was suffering from kidney stones until he collapsed from an unrelated condition last November. THE PATIENT. My kidney stone took me by surprise — I only discovered I had one after I collapsed with an unrelated condition last November. I run a 3D printing company which makes bones out of plaster of Paris for surgeons to use as practice models for complex orthopaedic operations. During a presentation to surgeons, I was suddenly floored by an agonising pain radiating across my lower stomach. I was taken to Southampton General Hospital, where I was shocked to learn I had an appendicitis. My appendix was removed that night. However, scans also revealed a large stone in my right kidney. Despite its size — 3.5cm by 2.5cm — it had given me none of the usual symptoms, such as pain or blood in the urine. Apparently it had developed because I had a kidney infection, which I didn’t even realise. The doctors said it might grow even bigger, so I was told I’d need further surgery to cut out the stone. It was a lot to take in while also facing having my appendix removed. But I’ve had operations on my knees, back and for hernias, and after my appendix agony I didn’t want even more pain from a growing stone. After they removed my appendix, I began wondering whether 3D technology might be helpful with my kidney operation. I discussed it with my consultant, urological surgeon Bhaskar Somani, suggesting that a life-size model of my kidney with the stone inside might give him accurate information about my operation. After he collapsed, John (pictured) was taken to\xa0Southampton General Hospital where he was diagnosed with appendicitis and had his appendix removed. He’d heard of 3D being used in orthopaedic operations such as hip replacements but, as far as he knew, it hadn’t been used with this kind of procedure. He agreed it might help — anything allowing a surgeon to visualise the area in more detail could only make surgery quicker and more accurate. I wasn’t due to have the stone removed until January this year, so, after taking two weeks off work to recover from the appendix operation, I began work on the model. The machine we use for 3D printing, known as an isodo3D, used images of my kidney from CT scans to recreate a model, slice by slice, using layers of plaster of Paris half a millimetre thick. John used images of his kidney from the CT scan to recreate a model, slice by slice using plaster of Paris (pictured). This allows the surgeon to complete surgery faster and more accurately. These layers were then laid on top of each other. The model was made in three coloured parts, so it could be taken apart like Lego pieces. This way, Mr Somani could work out the best angle to go into the kidney with his instruments. This planning can reduce operation times because it means less chance of having to rely on trial and error. The model took four hours to make and I was astonished when I saw the finished product — particularly the size of the stone. I couldn’t understand how something that big hadn’t caused me trouble. When I woke from the three-hour operation, I was a bit sore but was walking around within hours. I was in hospital for five days and had the stitches from my tiny wound taken out two weeks later. The replica of his kidney that John (pictured) created, allowed Mr Somani to work out the best angle to go into the kidney with his instruments. The soreness lasted a few days, but painkillers helped, and I was back in the office within ten days. I don’t know whether that’s because of the kidney model, but I like to think so. I’m planning to make more models for Mr Somani — for ten patients with kidney stones and ten with cancer. They cost £123 — but if it shortens operations and therefore reduces infection risk, it could be of massive benefit to the health service and save money in the long run. THE SURGEON. Bhaskar Somani is a consultant urological surgeon and specialist in endourology at University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust. Kidney stones occur when waste products removed from the blood form crystals, which over time form hard stones. If they’re not completely blocking tubes in and around the kidneys, they should pass naturally within five weeks. But larger stones can get stuck — they can be extremely painful and lead to infections. John (pictured) is now planning to make more models for Mr Somani, costing £123 a piece. John’s was a large stone that would have been hard to pass and he needed an operation, a keyhole procedure called percutaneous nephrolithotomy. It’s quite complex surgery — there is a risk of bleeding because the kidney has such a rich blood supply. In up to 5 per cent of cases, patients need a transfusion. A CT scan and X-rays are taken beforehand to pinpoint the exact location of a kidney stone. But I felt having a 3D model as well would give us even more detail: I’d be able to hold the model, take it apart, see the exact location of the stone and plan the precise angle of our surgical instruments. I kept the model throughout the surgery to consolidate what I was seeing on screen. We started the procedure by passing a camera — a cystoscope — through the urethra and up into the bladder. This meant I could see the stone on a screen. Then John was turned on his front and I made a 1cm incision on his right-hand side, just below the ribcage in his back. Then we punctured the kidney with a fine needle, which helped create a tract, or tunnel, for us to access the kidney. This was done under X-ray guidance. Next, I passed a hollow tube known as a dilator into this tract, to enlarge it, so we could then insert a telescope, allowing images to be produced on screen. Then, using ultrasound energy pumped through a tiny probe, we broke the stone into fragments, before sucking them out using a pump inserted through the small puncture in the back. Throughout the procedure, having the model as a point of reference was very useful, allowing me to visualise in 3D what was happening at each stage. Typical risks of the procedure include excess bleeding, as well as injuring the structures surrounding the kidney, but having a model helps minimise risks. John has also created a model of a kidney with a cancerous tumour (left). The right-hand picture shows the model of John's own kidney stone. I hope this technology soon becomes widely available. I carry out around 250 kidney-stone procedures a year, around 30 of which are large and complex. The model could speed up procedures like this by 30 minutes as it will take less time to plan how to access the kidney. This in turn could reduce infection time and complication rates. It could be helpful when removing tumours, too. It’s also useful to show the patient a model when explaining the procedure, and it could also help in training the surgeons of tomorrow. ANY DRAWBACKS? ‘There’s no doubt that having a model to study before surgery and then to refer to a during an operation can only increase its success,’ says Christopher Eden, a consultant urologist at the Royal Surrey County Hospital in Guildford. ‘Kidney stones — especially large ones — can involve fairly complicated surgery. And, with keyhole surgery, when you are operating with a telescope, you need to plan in a methodical fashion beforehand. A model like this is certainly the way forward for this sort of surgery.’ The surgery costs between £10,000 and £12,000 privately, and is a similar cost to the NHS.\n\nSummary:", params:

Please output the summary only, without any other text.\n\nArticle:\nTwelve years ago 24 photographers decided to carry out an ambitious project - to document a full New Year\'s Day every year for 24 years. To begin with each was allocated one hour of the day to record what was going on around them. But the project did not stop there. This was a project that was to last 24 years, with each photographer progressing one hour every year, so that at the end of 24 years, there will be 24 sets of images from New Year\'s Day - or 576 images. 00.00 by Yvonne De Rosa – Untitled: \'I was in Reykjavik and I was with friends in the square close to the main church.\' To contrast with the chaos she took this picture of a couple in \'a calm embrace and in their own magic space\' The original 24 photographers met while studying on a postgraduate photography course at Central St Martin\'s in London. Six prints from this year\'s project will be auctioned off in aid of Hope and Homes for Children, an international charity working to ensure that all children have the chance to grow up in the love of a family. Curator Bridget Coaker said: \'When I first heard about 24photography I thought what a great idea, I do hope they manage to keep the momentum going. Now in its 12th year this group of dedicated photographers are still going out in all weathers and all hours to capture something that shows something of the first day of each New Year. Their commitment to the project is inspiring.\' Claire Spreadbury, founder of 24photography, said: \'The exhibition is going from strength to strength and now in our twelfth year we\'ve really developed an identity and feel that we\'re an established part of London\'s art calendar. New Year\'s Day is an exciting time of the year, and we hope that 24 captures some of that excitement, but also gives a little glimpse into the rest of the day after the celebrations and parties.\' 01:00 by Algy Sharman – Superhero: \'This shot was taken in a cafe near a spooky industrial estate outside Stockholm.This guy and his buddy were out skateboarding. He was waiting for a kebab, so was I\' 02:00 by Alex Christofides – Untitled: Alex is fascinated with the human condition, how we relate to one another and our environment. His documentary work explores social issues such as mental health awareness and social exclusion. 03:00 by Christoph Grothgar – Off-centre… but this universe is for you: \'The photograph is of the last firework I had kept until my time slot had come. While taking the picture, I had think of someone who told me that I shouldn’t always have everything in the centre, so I took it off-centre\' 04:00 by Virginia Standard-Sheader: \'My image was taken in Hanoi, Vietnam, in the old quarter. Showing a young man, sleeping on his bike oblivious to the chaos around him\' 05:00 by JF VALLET - dancing with the death: \'My picture was taken in my flat in Paris, back from a new year\'s eve party. A little bit tired, i was wondering what i could shoot and discussing about that with my room-mate Laurent, we had the idea to play with the science skeleton belonging to my wife Marion. A lot of scenes were tried in an self-portrait mode and at a moment, i decided to dance with the skeleton. Getting older, 2015 is for me the step to the age of fourty. Dancing with the death is an ironic reference for me, as if i was daring the death\' 06:00 by Ali Waggie – Celestial watcher guardian angel: \'Every night this constellation stands above us. He watches from on high, what has he seen, heard? Powerless to help as mankind destroys the earth below\' 07:00 by Colin Blackstock - The restless cries: \'Hours earlier cheers and joyous voices welcomed a new year with Champagne toasts and fireworks, the remnants of which line the banks of the river. Billingsgate is silent now, but what crepuscular cries echo through the ages here\' 08:00 by Rachel Sato Banks-Lust: \'My image was taken in Amsterdam, around the Red Light, near where I live. New Years is an experience, in this city, that is particularly colourful. There\'s also a dark and mysterious energy about Amsterdam: it bubbles at the surface of what you can see... beyond the tourists. It\'s fascinating. And part of why I love this city\' 09:00 by Sarah Lucy Brown– Mono no aware: \'Due to an unseasonably warm start to the winter, this delicate cherry blossom tree had flowered already. It caught my eye and I felt that it symbolised a good start to the New Year\' 10:00 by Nicky Willcock – The house where Matt lived. 11:00 by Enrico Vietti – Asian Xmas: \'Christmas time in Asia is a good example of the (often tacky) mix between different cultures. Even in 20 degrees, you can see Santa Claus in the streets and Christmas trees are everywhere, although they tend to be integrated in some Asian context and elements. Picture has been taken in Hoi An, Vietnam, a city well known for its tailors and lanterns\' 12:00 by David Mazza – Decade: \'Ten years ago we were married on our farm in Western Australia. New Year’s day 2015, became a beautiful summer evening and the kids wanted to go for a walk up to Wedding Hill\' 13:00 by Pierre Mansiet– Modern day hero: \'The "Modern Day Hero" image was done during the new year\'s parade on Champs Elysées and the "star" of the parade was this Hero Go Pro camera attached to its telescopic cane/stick - a sort of prothesis extension on many arms / hands.They were all over and are developing quickly. I know the National Museum in Washington DC forbid them in the museum as they were so many of them and this started to cause problems\' 14:00 by Guy Bell – I love you: \'New Year’s Day offers people the chance to consider changes as well as relax. I decided to go to Winter Wonderland, in Hyde Park, to gauge the mood. I expecteda sea of miserable people trudging around and being ripped off but, instead, saw a more cheery view of life – how simple and sometimes corny things (fairground rides, soft toys, balloons and hotdogs) can entertain and genuinely lift the mood\' 15:00 by Lola Nichols – On the edge. 16:00 by Charlotte Duval – Untitled: \'Connected. Everywhere. All the time. Every day\' 17:00 by Anthony Curran – Alone: \'New Year\'s Day is a busy time, the sales are on in Oxford Street and the area is packed with people. Despite this there is still plenty of opportunity for people to be isolated. New technology can make thismore bearable, whilst at the same time making it more likely\' 18:00 by Candida Jones- Hangover: My image: \'Hangover, was taken in Tooting (Wandsworth). For me it sums up how many of us feel on New Year\'s Day; tired, aching, and more than a little green around the gills\' 19:00 by Raphael Schutzer-Weissmann - Intolerance: \'I took this photo in response to the anti-immigrant rhetoric increasinglynoticeable in the UK and Europe recently. At first it seemed Romanians were the target; but the Charlie Hebdo atrocity took things to a new level; it became a blame game; blame the immigrants, blame theMuslims, blame the Jews, blame somebody, for something. To my mind inclusiveness and diversity are things to be celebrated, not demonised\' 20:00 by Helen Chambers – Quietways and Superhighways: \'This picture was taken crossing London Fields on the way back from seeing friends … the day after the night before. The park felt quiet compared to usual, but it struck me that there is always a hum in London and the constant signs of people interacting, no matter what day of the year\' 21:00 by Claire Spreadbury - Untitled: \'My image is intended to portray the innocence of childhood as well as capturing the fashion of the time - the Onesie\' 22:00 by Gavin Morris - Bag of Bands: Gavin Morris is an artist teacher living and working in South Devon. His photograph was taken at 22:00 in south London whilst visiting friends. The image shows the inside of a bag of his daughter\'s loom bands, their bright colours and huge numbers have been a major feature both at home and away and will continue to be into 2015. 23:00 by Gas Esilarante – All was homely in Iceland: \'Here\'s what we\'re used to breathing. Little by little we learn not to see and not to think.Gas esilarante means laughing gas: it causes euphoria or confusion. The anesthetic effect of nitrous oxide is not well-documented in detail, but it is thought that it interacts with the brain by altering intercellular communication at synapses. It is classified as a soft drug.

A mother has said she is 'heartbroken' after her three-month-old daughter was found dead at their home in Dundee. Police have launched a probe into the 'unexplained death' of\xa0Sophia Walker after she was found unresponsive in the early hours of\xa0Saturday. Her mother Patricia Hodgdon, 34, wrote a series of messages on Facebook saying: 'Me and Chaz hearts broken lost my princess don't want to speak. 'I want her back. Please please. Why why please say I'm dreaming plz.' Ambulance crews rushed to the home in Dundee\xa0after receiving reports of the  sudden death, but they were unable to revive the baby. It is understood that Sophia\xa0was born premature in late December and lived with her mother and father, Charles Walker, at the home in Kirkton. Both the parents were being comforted by friends and relatives today and\xa0flowers were laid at the gate of the house. Police Scotland confirmed an investigation has been launched into the death and that it is being treated as unexplained. A spokesman said: 'The death is being treated as unexplained. Inquiries are at an early stage and as is standard practice a report will be submitted to the Procurator Fiscal.' Neighbour Dexylee Mullady, 19, said she was shocked and saddened that the baby had died. She said: 'I have only ever seen pictures of her on Facebook and never seen her outside. She looked like she was a tiny little thing - I can't believe this has happened. 'This is really horrible - we can't imagine what the family must be going through.' She said police had been outside the home in Dundee all weekend. A police van  was outside the home in Dundee all weekend and friends left flowers and tributes at the gate.\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=128, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=False, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: [128000, 9370, 5730, 553, 279, 2768, 3754, 4652, 304, 220, 4386, 11460, 13, 5321, 2612, 279, 12399, 1193, 11, 2085, 904, 1023, 1495, 382, 17064, 512, 22993, 617, 11887, 264, 22477, 1139, 279, 364, 359, 81950, 4648, 6, 315, 71471, 23074, 320, 69389, 8, 1306, 1364, 574, 1766, 653, 52397, 304, 279, 4216, 4207, 315, 7884, 13, 362, 6691, 706, 1071, 1364, 374, 364, 18207, 50009, 6, 1306, 1077, 2380, 23086, 6418, 10003, 574, 1766, 5710, 520, 872, 2162, 304, 75015, 2176, 13, 10289, 617, 11887, 264, 22477, 1139, 279, 364, 359, 81950, 4648, 6, 315, 4194, 86332, 689, 23074, 1306, 1364, 574, 1766, 653, 52397, 304, 279, 4216, 4207, 315, 4194, 34774, 13, 6385, 6691, 55034, 83984, 15357, 11, 220, 1958, 11, 6267, 264, 4101, 315, 6743, 389, 5690, 5605, 25, 364, 7979, 323, 921, 1394, 23492, 11102, 5675, 856, 40688, 1541, 956, 1390, 311, 6604, 13, 364, 40, 1390, 1077, 1203, 13, 5321, 4587, 13, 8595, 3249, 4587, 2019, 358, 2846, 56774, 628, 89, 3238, 20423, 41932, 43160, 33341, 311, 279, 2162, 304, 75015, 2176, 4194, 10924, 12588, 6821, 315, 279, 220, 11210, 4648, 11, 719, 814, 1051, 12153, 311, 59816, 279, 8945, 13, 1102, 374, 16365, 430, 71471, 4194, 16514, 9405, 42227, 304, 3389, 6790, 323, 12439, 449, 1077, 6691, 323, 7126, 11, 15274, 23074, 11, 520, 279, 2162, 304, 32446, 783, 13, 11995, 279, 6699, 1051, 1694, 6981, 291, 555, 4885, 323, 29658, 3432, 323, 4194, 89770, 1051, 17551, 520, 279, 18618, 315, 279, 3838, 13, 10289, 19627, 11007, 459, 8990, 706, 1027, 11887, 1139, 279, 4648, 323, 430, 433, 374, 1694, 12020, 439, 653, 81950, 13, 362, 18367, 1071, 25, 364, 791, 4648, 374, 1694, 12020, 439, 653, 81950, 13, 763, 33000, 527, 520, 459, 4216, 6566, 323, 439, 374, 5410, 6725, 264, 1934, 690, 387, 14976, 311, 279, 1322, 2407, 859, 64072, 3238, 4275, 47918, 73742, 982, 68, 52627, 7759, 11, 220, 777, 11, 1071, 1364, 574, 27718, 323, 95017, 430, 279, 8945, 1047, 8636, 13, 3005, 1071, 25, 364, 40, 617, 1193, 3596, 3970, 9364, 315, 1077, 389, 5690, 323, 2646, 3970, 1077, 4994, 13, 3005, 7111, 1093, 1364, 574, 264, 13987, 2697, 3245, 482, 358, 649, 956, 4510, 420, 706, 7077, 13, 364, 2028, 374, 2216, 28201, 482, 584, 649, 956, 13085, 1148, 279, 3070, 2011, 387, 2133, 1555, 3238, 3005, 1071, 4379, 1047, 1027, 4994, 279, 2162, 304, 75015, 2176, 682, 9178, 13, 362, 4379, 5355, 220, 574, 4994, 279, 2162, 304, 75015, 2176, 682, 9178, 323, 4885, 2163, 19837, 323, 14121, 2142, 520, 279, 18618, 382, 19791, 25], prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

Please output the summary only, without any other text.\n\nArticle:\nA father-of-three who claims he has spent 53 years living in Britain is facing deportation back to the U.S after being caught up in an immigration crackdown. Robert Carl Jordan was born in the U.S to an American soldier and a so-called 'GI Bride' - one of thousands of British women who crossed the Atlantic to marry soldiers during the Second World War. But when his parents split up when he was aged three, Mr Jordan moved back to Manchester with his mother. Robert Carl Jordan who claims he has spent 53 years living in Britain - including paying taxes and starting a family - is facing deportation back to the U.S after being caught up in an immigration crackdown. The 56-year-old, who lives close to his elderly mother in Haughton Green, Tameside, says he then set up a life for himself in the UK, which involved attending school, paying taxes and working for four decades. He also married a British woman with whom he had three children. But, since arriving in 1963, neither he nor his mother has ever sought to obtain British citizenship for Mr Jordan, believing he was entitled to stay in the country on account of his mother's nationality. In fact, those who are born to British parents outside of the UK are not automatically given a permanent right to remain - and he should have applied for citizenship. Now, the Government has decided Mr Jordan should be deported from the UK because he does not have the correct paperwork to allow him to stay. Mr Jordan, who has until April 6 to appeal the decision, said: 'I thought it would be all right because I've been married here, I've got three kids and all my family are here. I didn't think it was going to get this serious.' The former railway guard and Royal Mail postman claims he did not know anything about applying for citizenship until immigration officers turned up at the pub where he worked just before Christmas. The father-of-three, pictured with his son Matthew and daughter Chloe, has until April 6 to appeal Government's decision to send him back to the U.S because he does not have the right paperwork. After receiving an anonymous tip-off about Mr Jordan's situation, officials arrested him for working illegally in the UK. He was then released on the condition that he reports regularly to an immigration centre in Salford. Many Europeans who have been in similar situations to Mr Jordan have managed to stay in the UK due to their right to private and family life, under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. In 2011, Amir Beheshti, from Iran - who had been trying to get refugee status for seven years but had the claim repeatedly turned down - was allowed to stay in the UK because he said he had a private life that involves going for work-outs with his friends. The 40-year-old's lawyers argued his human rights would be violated if he was deported because he had become 'well integrated' in the Glasgow community. The controversial legal ruling by Scotland’s Court of Session meant the threat of deportation has been removed and Beheshti is free to remain in Scotland indefinitely. Beheshti’s claim, it said, was ‘based on Article 8 ECHR and, in particular, on the fact that he had, so he claimed, established a private life in the UK. Earlier this month,\xa0Branko Loncar, 55 - who won asylum by claiming he fled Croatia due to anti-Serb discrimination - was allowed to stay in the UK, despite being convicted of killing his wife. Since being convicted of the crime in his absence during a retrial in 2000, Croatia had asked for Loncar's extradition from UK - but his lawyers fought move. They argued that he had right to family life with his new Serbian partner in the UK - despite the pair living hundreds of miles away from one another. In the meantime, Loncar continued claiming benefits and was convicted of common assault in the UK. But the High Court still ruled that it would be 'oppressive' to send Loncar back after so long. But Mr Johnson, who is a father to Nicky, 30, Matthew, 20, and Chloe, 15, has now been told to leave the country. The Home Office says Mr Johnson was told he needed to apply for residency in 2007 after being granted a visitor's visa following a two-month holiday away from the UK. But officials said he has failed to provide evidence of long term residency in the country - evidence which would usually come in the form of medical history, tax contributions and evidence of education. Mr Jordan, who has now split from his wife, says he cannot bear the thought of being forced to leave and having to say goodbye to his children. He said: 'I have lived here all my life. I went to school here, I've worked here for 40 years. 'But now I've been told I've been working illegally all that time, even though I've got a National Insurance number and paid my taxes. 'I've not been sleeping or eating. Every time I see my daughter she cries and that sets me off.' Many Europeans who have been in similar situations to Mr Jordan have managed to stay in the UK due to their right to private and family life, under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. Thousands have now signed an online petition requesting he be allowed to say. It reads: 'Carl has a close relationship with his children, who are, in the least to say, devastated by this turn of events, especially his daughter, the youngest child. Carl's elderly Mother is also reliant upon him and would therefore be left without the help and care she currently gets from her Son.' Denton MP Andrew Gwynne is also backing his campaign and has asked the government to grant Mr Jordan discretionary leave while he applies for dual nationality. Mr Gwynne said: 'My office has asked the immigration minister to grant discretionary leave for Mr Jordan to remain... while he applies for dual nationality, which he has the right to do because his mother is British. 'I am fully supportive of Mr Jordan. I do feel that he should be given the right to stay.' A Home Office spokesman said: 'People born overseas to a British parent do not gain an automatic right to long term residency in the UK, and the onus is on the individual to ensure their immigration status is free of time restrictions. 'Mr Jordan was told in 2007 of the need to formalise his stay in the UK by providing evidence to support his claim of long term residency. He was also advised in writing on three occasions what level of evidence is required but he has still failed to provide it.'\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0,

Joanne Dowsett had been drinking for hours when she returned to her parents' home in Stockport last October. Having downed ten shots of Sourz and rum and Cokes, the 20-year-old care worker took anti-nausea pills at around 3am, causing her to collapse and suffer a seizure. She was found dead the following afternoon at 4pm having rowed with her parents after being accused of taking drugs, an inquest into her death heard. Joanne Dowsett died after consuming a cocktail of alcohol and anti-sickness pills. The 20-year-old had 'no intention of taking her own life,' an inquest heard. On the night in question, Miss Dowsett had been in several pubs and bars with Joshua Beaumont on a date. The pair drank Jagerbombs, beer, rum and Coke and shots before Mr Beaumont walked her home. Giving evidence, the 22-year-old said Miss Dowsett had been acting normally when he bid her goodnight. 'Jo seemed to be fine, she wasn't slurring her words or falling,' he said. 'She asked me to walk her home and said she would phone me a cab from her house. We stood on the drive chatting together and we were discussing about going out again. 'She didn’t seem to be particularly drunk.' After being collected from her parents' house in a taxi, Mr Beamont said the pair continued to talk over text. Shortly before 3am, Miss Dowsett told him she was going to bed before phoning another friend, Samuel Higginbotham. The 20-year-old care worker returned to her parents' house in Stockport where they rowed over her 'erratic behaviour', it was claimed. Joshua Beaumont said Miss Dowsett did not seem unwell when he left her at her parents' house to get a taxi. During their conversation she told him she had just rowed with her parents. John and Ann Dowsett were worried their daughter had been taking drugs after seeing her behave 'erratically', it was claimed. 'She was at home and couldn't sleep and knew I would be up. I asked about the date and she didn't go in to great detail,' Mr\xa0Higginbotham said. 'She said her mum and dad came in after the date and she told them to leave. There was nothing else in the phone call that rang alarm bells or made me feel the need to ring her back.' In text messages to others Miss Dowsett had given mixed accounts of the date, telling some she was eager to see Mr Beaumont again and others that she wasn't interested. 'She said to some the date had been great and to others saying it had been less than great,' said\xa0Det Insp Cheryl Hughes of Greater Manchester Police. 'Within texts to a friend by the name of Ben she explains the altercation with her parents where she had been accused of taking drugs but she said she hadn't had any drugs. 'Clearly Joanne had mixed emotions about the date where she is not telling the truth to each person she had contact with. 'Her behaviour in the early hours was erratic and gave rise to concern by her parents. 'We found no evidence she wanted to take her own life, in fact texts indicated she was going out for drinks on the Saturday night and she gave Mr Beaumont the impression they were going on another date.' The 20-year-old had fatal traces of the drug in her system. Police said there was no indication that she intended to take her own life. In text messages sent the night before she died, Miss Dowsett arranged to meet friends for drinks and a second date with Mr Beaumont. At 4pm the following day she was found face down in her bedroom. A toxicology report indicated she was just over the drink drive limit and had fatal amounts of cyclizine in her system. The drug is often prescribed to treat nausea and travel sickness. After searching her bedroom investigators discovered she had taken a substantial number of the pills. 'Whether it was deliberate or an accumulation is more difficult to assess. Fatality is very rare,' said toxicologist Julie Evans. While Miss Dowsett had been drinking, a pathologist concluded she died as a result of the cocktail of drugs and alcohol. Recording a conclusion of misadventure, coroner John Pollard said: 'She had taken alcohol for the buzz effect and one does hear of youngsters taking fairly prodigious amounts these days but I don’t think she did anything unusual in the amount she took while she was out. 'Then you link that with the cyclizine. She has taken them to stop her feeling sick and an unintended outcome was they connected with the alcohol and have been more than her body can cope with.'\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1,

Please output the summary only, without any other text.\n\nArticle:\nTOM JONES: THE LIFE. by Sean Smith. (HarperCollins £18.99) Tom Jones has been a genuine global star for half a century. How many other people can say that? By my reckoning, it’s no more than a handful: Paul McCartney, Mick Jagger, Bob Dylan, Clint Eastwood and HM The Queen. And only one of them, I believe, lives in a larger house than Sir Tom’s. Sir Tom Jones (pictured in Los Angeles in 1978) had his first No 1 in the UK in March 1965. It was in March 1965 that his first hit, It’s Not Unusual, went to No 1 in the UK and made him famous. To this day, the fame is untainted and the talent uneroded. Another significant milestone approaches on June 7, when he will turn 75 years old. All of which makes him the perfect subject for a lavishly appointed, no-holds-barred hardback biography. Smith’s is not the first — in fact, it’s the twelfth. But it’s the first for nearly two years, and should keep us going until the autumn, when Sir Tom’s autobiography is due out. What else will the great man be able to reveal, given that almost every imaginable revelation has already been made? Tom (pictured in early 1970s) married his wife Linda in 1957 when they were both only 16-years-old. For Sir Tom has not lived a particularly secretive life. Though married to Linda, nee Trenchard, for 58 years, and happily so, he has enjoyed a prolific extra-curricular love life. But as long as Linda doesn’t have to read about it in the newspaper — let’s hope she doesn’t read this — she turns a blind eye. It’s not just a matter of having your cake and eating it. It’s having more cake than anyone else has ever had and eating every last crumb of it. Such opportunities would never have arisen, of course, without the talent. Jones was born with the gift of a golden voice, and he knows exactly what to do with it. This was apparent on his first hit, and has not wavered since. Tom Jones (pictured) was born\xa0Thomas Woodward but was persuaded to change his name by his manager\xa0Gordon Mills, who also persuaded the star to move to London from Wales. Quite what he should do with his career has not always been so obvious but, under the watchful eye of his son, Mark, who has managed him since the mid-Eighties, he has recaptured his place in the sun and gained a new generation of fans. Several generations, in fact. The backstory is well known. Babies hear it on their mothers’ knees, and then tell it to their own babies many years later. Born Thomas Woodward in Treforest, South Wales, the infant Tom ‘had an edge, even as a youngster in short trousers. He didn’t just sing a song; he performed it with verve and passion’. Aged 12, he lost a year at school through tuberculosis; at 16, he was married with a child on the way. ‘Most of the girls found him very attractive,’ said one schoolmate. ‘He seemed a bit rough to me, but he definitely had the charisma. He had a way with him, a swagger.’ Tom Jones (right) is pictured with his manager, Gordon Mills (left), in January 1969. Mills worked as the superstar's manager for 20 years until he died of cancer in 1986. The climb from obscurity, though, was long and arduous. Tom was a member of a band called The Senators, who weren’t going anywhere terribly fast. A sharp-eyed young manager, Gordon Mills, persuaded him to move to London, change his name to ‘Tom Jones’ and begin a solo career. He was already in his mid-20s. For 20 years, until Gordon died of cancer, Tom always deferred to his expertise. In return, Gordon did all Tom’s dirty work and sacked anyone who needed sacking. It was an arrangement that suited them both perfectly. Hits in the Sixties led to Las Vegas in the Seventies, and what might best be described as the Underwear Throwing Years. No bow-tie was larger or fluffier than Tom’s, no hips swivelled more suggestively. Elvis was a good friend and was convinced Tom wore a sock down the front of his trousers. Tom knew everyone and got on with nearly all of them, though he didn’t like it when John Lennon, with his characteristic Scouse wit, called him a ‘Welsh poof’. Would anyone? Tom (pictured) has been a judge on the Voice UK talent show since 2012, as has will.i.am (pictured) Nonetheless, an artistic nadir of some sort was reached when Tom recorded five consecutive country albums in the early Eighties. The live tours and Vegas residencies had made him hedge-fund rich. He and Linda lived in splendour in California, with many close relatives comfortably ensconced round the corner. But was it making him happy? Well, yes, but at the same time, Tom clearly needed to reconnect with the bluesier, rootsier music he had first loved. It hasn’t been an entirely easy ride since then, but his last two studio albums, Praise & Blame (2010) and Spirit In The Room (2012), have been the best of his long career. What comes over throughout the book is the straightforwardness of the man. Other stars say they might consider plastic surgery one day if the need arises, when they have clearly had the lot done. Sir Tom Jones has also had the lot done — but cheerfully admits to it. He has a reputation for being a little slow to put his hand in his pocket, yet is generous with family and close friends, as you or I would be in his position. He doesn’t like drugs or gambling, but enjoys a good cigar, and has drunk so much vintage champagne that at least one of his lovers was put off the stuff for good. Sir Tom (pictured), unlike many other celebrities, has admitted to having had plastic surgery work. Smith is an efficient chronicler of the life, as befits an old pro whose previous books have included Kylie, Gary (Barlow), Alesha (Dixon), Tulisa, Kate (Middleton), Cheryl and, of course, Victoria. There are a few factual errors that suggest speed of composition or just lack of knowledge: Leonard Cohen’s song is called Tower Of Song, not Tower Of Strength, for instance, and he doesn’t know that Burt Bacharach did not write the lyrics to his songs, which is a bit poor. But his book bounces along happily enough, forever marvelling that this faintly disgraceful old rake has been forgiven every-thing and become universally adored. As Rob Brydon put it when presenting him with yet another lifetime achievement award: ‘Tom Jones has lived the life we would all love to live.’ I have no doubt that women swooned and grown men wept, and Sir Tom probably sang It’s Not Unusual for about the 20,000th time.\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0,

They returned in a Soyuz capsule, landing southeast of the town of Zhezkazgan in Kazakhstan at 2.07am GMT (8.07am local time) this morning. One the ISS three crew members remain, and another three will join on 27 March - including two who will become the first to spend a year continuously on the station. Scroll down for video. What a view: Three astronauts have returned from the ISS after a six-month stay aboard the orbiting space station. The Soyuz TMA-14M (shown) took slightly more than three hours to return after leaving the ISS. This stunning image was taken from a helicopter as the capsule parachuted back to the ground by Nasa photographer Bill Ingalls. This landing brought to an end Expedition 42, carrying with it commander Barry Wilmore of Nasa and flight engineers Alexander Samokutyaev and Elena Serova of the Russian Federal Space Agency (Roscosmos). Serova was the first Russian female cosmonaut to work on the station in two decades. Construction of the ISS began on 20 November 1998. It supports a crew of up to six, with crews split into groups of three. The station orbits at a height of about 255 miles (410km). It has a total mass of about 990,000 pounds (450,000kg) and has living space roughly equivalent to a five-bedroom house. It completes an orbit of Earth every 92.91 minutes and moves at 17,100 miles (27,600km) per hour. It has now been in space for more than 5,900 days, during which time it has completed more than 92,000 orbits of Earth, and has been continuously occupied for more than 13 years. The Soyuz TMA-14M spacecraft, which brought them back to Earth, departed from the space station at 10.44pm GMT on Wednesday. It took them just over three hours to return. 'We wish you a good flight and a soft landing,' the remaining crew on the ISS said to the departing crew. After a few hours of free flight, the Soyuz burned its engine for four minutes and 41 seconds, reducing its velocity enough for it to plummet through the atmosphere, with the crew module separating from the other superfluous sections. Once through the atmosphere, a parachute deployed and brought the Soyuz to a relatively gentle - but still quite bumpy - landing on the ground. Extracted from the capsule, which was charred on re-entry, the three were seated in semi-reclined chairs for a breath of fresh air and first medical checks, bundled up in blankets to protect them from frigid temperatures. 'Everything is great, thank you. The guys are great and worked very well,' said a smiling Serova while a female doctor measured her pulse and blood pressure. 'Congratulations on the recent holiday,' a rescue and recovery team officer said to Serova, referring to the International Women's Day marked on 8 March. 'Everything is fine. I am drinking real tea with lemon,' Samokutyaev said with a smile. 'I am glad to be here,' Wilmore said in Russian before the three got into all-terrain vehicles and were taken to individual helicopters to be evacuated from the landing area. This landing brought to an end Expedition 42, bringing with it commander Barry 'Butch' Wilmore (right) of Nasa and flight engineers Alexander Samokutyaev (middle) and Elena Serova (left) of the Russian Federal Space Agency (Roscosmos). Once through the atmosphere, a parachute deployed and brought the Soyuz to a relatively gentle - but still quite bumpy - landing on the ground. Extracted from the capsule, which was charred on re-entry, the three were seated in semi-reclined chairs (shown) for a breath of fresh air and first medical checks, bundled up in blankets to protect them from frigid temperatures. Russia's space agency ground personnel check the Soyuz TMA-14M capsule shortly after the landing. 'Everything is great, thank you. The guys are great and worked very well,' said a smiling Serova, pictured here, while a female doctor measured her pulse and blood pressure. The Soyuz capsule landed 91 miles (146km) southeast of the town of Jezkazgan, or Zhezkazgan, in Kazakhstan at 2.07am GMT. 'Everything is fine. I am drinking real tea with lemon,' Samokutyaev, pictured, said with a smile after the landing. While on the station, the crew participated in a variety of research focusing on the effects of microgravity on cells, Earth observation, physical science and biological and molecular science. One of several key research focus areas during Expedition 42 was human health management for long-duration space travel, as Nasa and Roscosmos prepare for two crew members to spend one year aboard the space station. On 27 March, Nasa astronaut Scott Kelly and Roscosmos cosmonaut Mikhail Kornienko will undertake the first year-long stay aboard the International Space Station, to prepare astronauts for long-duration missions to Mars. The mission is designed to see how astronauts cope with such a prolonged stay in space - previously, crews only spent a maximum of six months aboard the station before returning to Earth. Expedition 42 also tested the Cloud-Aerosol Transport System (CATS), which provides data to improve scientists' understanding of the structure and evolution of Earth's atmosphere. This may lead to enhancements to spacecraft launches, landings and communications systems; help guide future atmospheric investigations of Mars, Jupiter or other worlds; and help researchers model and predict climate changes on Earth. The station crew also welcomed three cargo spacecraft with several tons of scientific investigations, food, fuel and other supplies. One of the last pictures taken by Samantha Cristoforetti Expedition 42 Flight Engineer. before she came back to Earth. Construction of the ISS (shown) began on 20 November 1998. It supports a crew of up to six ay any one time, with crews split into groups of three. It has been continuously manned since 2 November 2000. The Soyuz TMA-14M spacecraft is seen as it lands with the Expedition 42 crew near the town of Zhezkazgan, Kazakhstan today. The crew returned after almost six months onboard the International Space Station where they served as members of the Expedition 41 and 42 crews. A fleet of ground vehicles and aircraft, such as the helicopter in the distance, are used to secure the Soyuz and rescue the crew when it lands. After a brief rest, the three got into all-terrain vehicles and were taken to individual helicopters to be evacuated from the landing area. Pictured from left to right in this photo of the entire Expedition 42 crew are Yelena Serova, Barry Wilmore, Alexander Samokutyaev, Anton Shkaplerov, Terry Virts and Samantha Cristoforetti. In January, the trio helped grapple and connect a SpaceX Dragon spacecraft on the company's fifth contracted commercial resupply mission to the station. The Dragon returned to Earth in February with critical science samples. Two Russian ISS Progress cargo craft docked to the station in October and February, while the fifth and final European Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV), bearing the name of Belgian physicist Georges Lemaître, considered the father of the Big-Bang theory, departed the station in February. During his time on the orbital complex, Wilmore ventured outside the space station with Nasa astronaut Terry Virts on three spacewalks to prepare for new international docking adapters and future US commercial crew spacecraft. Wilmore also completed a spacewalk in October with fellow Nasa astronaut Reid Wiseman to replace a failed voltage regulator. Samokutyaev conducted one spacewalk during his time in space. During his time on the orbital complex, Wilmore ventured outside the space station (pictured) with Nasa astronaut Terry Virts on three spacewalks to prepare for new international docking adapters and future US commercial crew spacecraft. Having completed his second space station mission, Samokutyaev now has spent 331 days in space. Wilmore, having previously flown as a shuttle pilot on STS-129, has spent 178 days in space. Serova spent 167 days in space on this, her first flight. Expedition 43 currently is operating the station, with Virts in command. Flight engineers Anton Shkaplerov of Roscosmos and Samantha Cristoforetti of Esa are continuing station research and operations until their three new crewmates arrive in two weeks. On 27 March, Nasa astronaut Scott Kelly (left) and Roscosmos cosmonaut Mikhail Kornienko (right) will undertake the first year-long stay aboard the International Space Station, to prepare astronauts for long-duration missions to Mars.\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0,

The announcement came during an investors meeting today in New York City. The US retail chain, which is based in Minneapolis, Minnesota, said the cost-cutting measures 'will fuel Target's growth and drive profitability'. Target, which is based in Minneapolis, Minnesota, announced it will cut $2billion over the next two years. The discount chain's cost-cutting measures will result in'several thousand' jobs being eliminated. Board chairman and chief executive Brian Cornell, who joined the company last August, detailed how the restructuring program will\xa0'transform the retailer's business'. He said: 'Following a thorough, strategic review of our business, coupled with a careful evaluation of the changing retail landscape, we have identified the key initiatives that will put Target on a clear path to growth. 'We're focused on our future and building the capabilities that will take us further, faster. 'Redefining Target will require a renewed emphasis on prioritization and innovation, and above all else, putting our guests first in everything we do.' Target has 1,795 stores across the United States. The discount retailer employs about 350,000 people globally, according to the Star Tribune. About 13,500 employees work at its headquarters operations in the Twin Cities. Board chairman and CEO Brian Cornell detailed how the restructuring will 'transform the retailer's business' The chain has been struggling after millions of customers had their data stolen in a 2013 hacking attack and the company made an unsuccessful foray into Canada. Cornell's plan has $500million in cuts targeted for this year. It also includes a $1billion investment in technology and the supply chain. Part of the plan also involves exiting Canada. In January Target announced its Canadian subsidiary, which had filed for bankruptcy protection, would close all of its 133 stores, resulting in the loss of 17,600 jobs. At the time, Cornell  said the company had not been able to find a way to make Target Canada profitable until at least 2021. Target projected its 2015 sales growth at two or three per cent. It also estimated earnings of $4.45-4.65 per stock share which exceeds analysts' expectations of $4.50\xa0at best. Target shares closed 0.4 per cent higher at $78.00 after the announcement.\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=128, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=False, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: [128000, 9370, 5730, 553, 279, 2768, 3754, 4652, 304, 220, 4386, 11460, 13, 5321, 2612, 279, 12399, 1193, 11, 2085, 904, 1023, 1495, 382, 17064, 512, 6531, 7376, 433, 690, 387, 3339, 400, 17, 65, 15068, 304, 15455, 323, 93043, 596, 2099, 278, 16579, 6, 7032, 927, 279, 1828, 1403, 1667, 13, 578, 17480, 3782, 2391, 459, 15167, 6574, 3432, 304, 1561, 4356, 4409, 13, 578, 2326, 11040, 8957, 11, 902, 374, 3196, 304, 42958, 11, 19461, 11, 1071, 279, 2853, 43321, 1303, 11193, 364, 14724, 10633, 13791, 596, 6650, 323, 6678, 63336, 4527, 13791, 11, 902, 374, 3196, 304, 42958, 11, 19461, 11, 7376, 433, 690, 4018, 400, 17, 65, 15068, 927, 279, 1828, 1403, 1667, 13, 578, 11336, 8957, 596, 2853, 43321, 1303, 11193, 690, 1121, 304, 596, 2099, 278, 16579, 6, 7032, 1694, 34373, 13, 8925, 21892, 323, 10388, 11145, 17520, 56819, 11, 889, 11096, 279, 2883, 1566, 6287, 11, 11944, 1268, 279, 69027, 2068, 690, 4194, 956, 34489, 630, 279, 37891, 596, 2626, 4527, 1283, 1071, 25, 364, 28055, 264, 17879, 11, 19092, 3477, 315, 1057, 2626, 11, 34356, 449, 264, 16994, 16865, 315, 279, 10223, 11040, 18921, 11, 584, 617, 11054, 279, 1401, 28271, 430, 690, 2231, 13791, 389, 264, 2867, 1853, 311, 6650, 13, 364, 1687, 2351, 10968, 389, 1057, 3938, 323, 4857, 279, 17357, 430, 690, 1935, 603, 4726, 11, 10819, 13, 364, 49, 4313, 5859, 13791, 690, 1397, 264, 36646, 25679, 389, 45777, 2065, 323, 19297, 11, 323, 3485, 682, 775, 11, 10917, 1057, 15051, 1176, 304, 4395, 584, 656, 3238, 13791, 706, 220, 16, 11, 25808, 10756, 4028, 279, 3723, 4273, 13, 578, 11336, 37891, 51242, 922, 220, 8652, 11, 931, 1274, 31550, 11, 4184, 311, 279, 7834, 41439, 13, 10180, 220, 1032, 11, 2636, 8420, 990, 520, 1202, 26097, 7677, 304, 279, 36047, 38373, 13, 8925, 21892, 323, 12432, 17520, 56819, 11944, 1268, 279, 69027, 690, 364, 4806, 279, 37891, 596, 2626, 6, 578, 8957, 706, 1027, 20558, 1306, 11990, 315, 6444, 1047, 872, 828, 23130, 304, 264, 220, 679, 18, 39238, 3440, 323, 279, 2883, 1903, 459, 46025, 369, 352, 1139, 7008, 13, 56819, 596, 3197, 706, 400, 2636, 59413, 304, 15455, 17550, 369, 420, 1060, 13, 1102, 1101, 5764, 264, 400, 16, 65, 15068, 9341, 304, 5557, 323, 279, 8312, 8957, 13, 3744, 315, 279, 3197, 1101, 18065, 45848, 7008, 13, 763, 6186, 13791, 7376, 1202, 12152, 41164, 11, 902, 1047, 13019, 369, 36707, 9313, 11, 1053, 3345, 682, 315, 1202, 220, 9423, 10756, 11, 13239, 304, 279, 4814, 315, 220, 1114, 11, 5067, 7032, 13, 2468, 279, 892, 11, 56819, 220, 1071, 279, 2883, 1047, 539, 1027, 3025, 311, 1505, 264, 1648, 311, 1304, 13791, 7008, 34235, 3156, 520, 3325, 220, 2366, 16, 13, 13791, 28448, 1202, 220, 679, 20, 6763, 6650, 520, 1403, 477, 2380, 824, 2960, 13, 1102, 1101, 13240, 24608, 315, 400, 19, 13, 1774, 12, 19, 13, 2397, 824, 5708, 4430, 902, 36375, 31499, 6, 17078, 315, 400, 19, 13, 1135, 4194, 266, 1888, 13, 13791, 13551, 8036, 220, 15, 13, 19, 824, 2960, 5190, 520, 400, 2495, 13, 410, 1306, 279, 17480, 382, 19791, 25], prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

The former Manchester United manager replaced Jagoba Arrasate, who was sacked last year after a dismal start to the season left the Basque club in 19th place in La Liga. The 51-year-old Moyes has since led Real Sociedad away from the relegation zone and into ninth in the standings with 10 games of the season remaining. David Moyes has led Real Sociedad from the relegation places to mid table after taking charge in November. Real Sociedad striker Imanol Agirretxe celebrates after scoring in the win against Cordoba. 'It was hard for us to replace Jagoba,' Loren said in an interview with Spanish sports newspaper Marca. 'But the team needed to react and it certainly has done so. 'Our immediate aim has been achieved. 'I think the first thing that David (Moyes) did when he arrived was to try to give the team more solidness and consistency, and you can see that he has achieved that. 'The team is improving.' Moyes is under contract with Real Sociedad for another season. Moyes applauds the fans after leading Real Sociedad to their fourth win in five games. 'We were fortunate that a man that initially appeared inaccessible to Real Sociedad, ended up coming here,' Loren said. 'I believe he (Moyes) is giving a big contribution.' Loren believes the arrival of Moyes will open the door for the arrival of British players to the club in the near future. 'It's difficult to bring players from England, unless you have something that can attract the players,' Loren said. 'With Moyes here, the task of bringing players from there (England) can be made easier.' Real Sociedad return to La Liga action on Saturday when they play away to Malaga.\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=128, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=False, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: [128000, 9370, 5730, 553, 279, 2768, 3754, 4652, 304, 220, 4386, 11460, 13, 5321, 2612, 279, 12399, 1193, 11, 2085, 904, 1023, 1495, 382, 17064, 512, 13058, 27670, 40129, 36027, 7690, 52290, 706, 37475, 279, 990, 2884, 555, 7395, 6941, 77638, 288, 2533, 4737, 927, 279, 15506, 6469, 304, 6841, 13, 578, 4846, 19922, 3723, 6783, 12860, 30511, 27931, 18925, 300, 349, 11, 889, 574, 77561, 1566, 1060, 1306, 264, 94553, 1212, 311, 279, 3280, 2163, 279, 15004, 593, 6469, 304, 220, 777, 339, 2035, 304, 5034, 60127, 13, 578, 220, 3971, 4771, 6418, 77638, 288, 706, 2533, 6197, 8976, 27670, 40129, 3201, 505, 279, 59782, 367, 10353, 323, 1139, 43641, 304, 279, 68663, 449, 220, 605, 3953, 315, 279, 3280, 9861, 13, 6941, 77638, 288, 706, 6197, 8976, 27670, 40129, 505, 279, 59782, 367, 7634, 311, 5209, 2007, 1306, 4737, 6900, 304, 6841, 13, 8976, 27670, 40129, 45041, 358, 1543, 337, 4701, 404, 2171, 8536, 49193, 1306, 20413, 304, 279, 3243, 2403, 37987, 27931, 13, 364, 2181, 574, 2653, 369, 603, 311, 8454, 30511, 27931, 2965, 52290, 1071, 304, 459, 7274, 449, 15506, 10034, 17222, 2947, 936, 13, 364, 4071, 279, 2128, 4460, 311, 14085, 323, 433, 7995, 706, 2884, 779, 13, 364, 8140, 14247, 9395, 706, 1027, 17427, 13, 364, 40, 1781, 279, 1176, 3245, 430, 6941, 320, 44, 2303, 288, 8, 1550, 994, 568, 11721, 574, 311, 1456, 311, 3041, 279, 2128, 810, 6573, 2136, 323, 29237, 11, 323, 499, 649, 1518, 430, 568, 706, 17427, 430, 13, 364, 791, 2128, 374, 18899, 3238, 77638, 288, 374, 1234, 5226, 449, 8976, 27670, 40129, 369, 2500, 3280, 13, 77638, 288, 52490, 82, 279, 7359, 1306, 6522, 8976, 27670, 40129, 311, 872, 11999, 3243, 304, 4330, 3953, 13, 364, 1687, 1051, 40510, 430, 264, 893, 430, 15453, 9922, 82828, 311, 8976, 27670, 40129, 11, 9670, 709, 5108, 1618, 2965, 52290, 1071, 13, 364, 40, 4510, 568, 320, 44, 2303, 288, 8, 374, 7231, 264, 2466, 19035, 3238, 52290, 13919, 279, 19163, 315, 77638, 288, 690, 1825, 279, 6134, 369, 279, 19163, 315, 8013, 4311, 311, 279, 6469, 304, 279, 3221, 3938, 13, 364, 2181, 596, 5107, 311, 4546, 4311, 505, 9635, 11, 7389, 499, 617, 2555, 430, 649, 9504, 279, 4311, 2965, 52290, 1071, 13, 364, 2409, 77638, 288, 1618, 11, 279, 3465, 315, 12967, 4311, 505, 1070, 320, 67308, 8, 649, 387, 1903, 8831, 3238, 8976, 27670, 40129, 471, 311, 5034, 60127, 1957, 389, 7884, 994, 814, 1514, 3201, 311, 8560, 12748, 382, 19791, 25], prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

The Telemark Battalion is an elite mechanised infantry unit of the Norwegian Army which has been involved in the fight against the Taliban as part of the NATO-led security mission since 2003. Around 50 soldiers from Telemark will be heading to the city of Irbil in northern Iraq to train Kurdish forces to help them in their fight against Islamic State, the Norwegian ministry of defence has confirmed. It is thought the mission will begin in early April. Scroll down for video. The patch worn by Telemark Battalion soldiers (left), recalls the Punisher symbol of Marvel's comic book vigilante (right), with the words 'Jokke - we will never forget' honoring fallen comrade\xa0Claes Joachim Olsson. A Telemark soldier in action in Afghanistan. The battalion has been involved in the fight against the Taliban as part of the NATO-led security mission since 2003 and lost two soldiers in the conflict, including Olsson. ISIS fighters in Aleppo, Syria. Telemark troops are travelling to northern Iraq to train Kurdish Peshmerga forces in their fight against the extremists. Some instructors will also be sent to the Iraqi capital Baghdad in the hopes of stemming an insurgency which now controls large tracts of northern Iraq and Syria. The Telemark Battalion attracted headlines in 2010 when reports emerged some of its soldiers were spray-painting the Punisher symbol on houses and property belonging to Afghans suspected of being members of the Taliban. The Punisher is a Marvel Comics antihero and vigilante who slaughters criminals and mobsters and has a striking skull-shaped emblem. Since the death of Claes Joachim Olsson - known by his nickname 'Jokke' - in January 2010, some members of the unit took to wearing patches featuring the Punisher logo and the words 'Jokke - we will never forget'. The 22-year-old was killed when the storm tank he was travelling in was hit by a Taliban roadside bomb southeast of the village of\xa0Ghowrmach in northwest Afghanistan. Telemark Battalion commander Major Rune Wenneberg (pictured centre in the green beret) fires up his troops in Afghanistan with the rallying cry 'To Valhalla!' The insignia of the Telemark Battalion (left), which was lead by the fierce Major Rune Wenneberg (right) Telemark soldiers in Afghanistan, where they became famous for\xa0spray-painting the Punisher symbol on houses and property belonging to Afghans suspected of being members of the Taliban. The wearing of Punisher patches was subsequently banned by the Norwegian military leadership, though some soldiers reportedly continued to do so. Following Olsson's death a video emerged of company commander Major Rune Wenneberg firing up his troops with a rousing battle cry name-checking Valahalla, the mystical hall of Norse mythology where specially chosen warriors go after they've been killed in combat. During the footage Wenneberg reportedly cries: 'You are the predator. Taliban is the prey. To Valhalla!', as his troops punch their weapons in the air in support. One former soldier knows who firsthand how ferocious Telemark fighters can be is American Charles Stanley, who helped provide logistics for units from the Norwegian battalion when they underwent two weeks of cold weather training in preparation for deployment to Bosnia in the late 1990s. The 51-year-old, who is a former sergeant in the 82nd Airborne Division of the US Army, told MailOnline they would be a fierce asset to Kurdish Peshmerga troops in their efforts to combat murderous extremists. He said: 'ISIS should fear them for sure. They didn't hold back in work or play and when they went to the task of battle that was all of the business they cared for until the mission was completed. An Iraqi Kurdish Peshmerga fighter is pictured in September 2014 firing at Islamic State positions from the top of Mount Zardak, 25  kilometres east of Mosul in northern Iraq. Fighters like him are soon to benefit from the expertise of the Telemark Battalion - some of the fiercest soldiers in the world. ISIS fighters on the march. Charles Stanley, a former sergeant in the 82nd Airborne Division of the US Army, says the jihadists should fear the Norwegian forces being sent to aid their Kurdish enemies. ISIS has now expanded its reach across much of northern Iraq and holds the city of Mosul, around 90 kilometres from the Kurdistan capital Irbil, to where the 50 Telemark soldiers are being sent. 'ISIS is a force of uncontrolled chaos and they have no discipline or defined battlefield strategy other than overcome by force. 'This well-trained and disciplined unit of Norwegian soldiers would be able to make very short work of any ISIS soldiers they encountered.' Now a director of technology at a Catholic high school in Modesto, California, Mr Stanley added: 'My take on them is that they were a very aggressive and rugged team of warriors. 'They had the attitude of whatever comes our way we will demolish it, be that from eating chow to driving their mechanised vehicles. 'There was no half way with them - it was all or nothing in everything they did. I have a long history with airborne paratroopers and they are some of the toughest soldiers in the army, on and off duty - they train hard and play even harder. 'The Telemark Battalion guys were every bit if not more rough and tumble. 'I would say compared to other country's soldiers they were among some of the most competitive and competent warriors that I have ever worked with. 'When we were in [Operation] Desert Storm [against Saddam Hussein in 1990] their equivalent would have possibly been the French Foreign Legion soldiers as far as ferocity and competence goes.' American Sniper Chris Kyle, who had his own take on the Punisher symbol, which can be seen here on his cap. Kyle's logo, with the Punisher skull and cross hairs. The 11-year veteran of the 82nd Airborne and father-of-one, whose son is currently serving in the US Army, says the Punisher symbol was not being used when he worked with the soldiers. He said: 'That incident didn't happen until later in Afghanistan and I was aware of it and heard the stories. 'That type of scare tactic has been employed for many years by many armies - the Vietnam War had its death card ace of spades, and now they have moved to spray-painted skulls and comic book reference symbols. 'Chris Kyle the American Sniper had his also.' Kyle is known for using a variation of the Punisher symbol himself, featuring the words 'Despite what your momma told you...violence does solve problems'. The Telemark saboteurs back in Britain after the incredible raid. Six Norwegian soldiers destroyed Hitler's nuclear dream in February 1943 at the Norsk Hydro plant near the town of Rjukan, Norway. The Telemark Battalion share a name with a group of legendary Second World War saboteurs. The Heroes of Telemark (pictured), carried out a famous raid which helped thwart Hitler's plans to build a Nazi nuclear bomb. The team successfully destroyed a heavy water production facility at the Norsk Hydoelectric plant in Telemark, a region of southern Norway, in 1943. The raid, which is regarded as one of the most successful acts of sabotage in the whole war, was also remarkable for the fact all the team managed to escape by cross-country skiing 250 miles into Sweden. The heavy water or deuterium oxide which the Norsk plant produced, was essential to the German scientists working on an atomic bomb project and the allies were desperate to destroy it. It was no soft target. Perched on an icy ravine, surrounded by machine gun-toting guards and floodlights the plant was virtually impregnable. But the six-man all Norwegian squad from the Special Operations Executive, trained at\xa0Brickendonbury in Hertfordshire, managed to parachute in and get the job done. In what was known as Operation Gunnerside, the raiders broke into the plant and set charges, the explosion of which caused 1000lbs of heavy water to wash away. They then made their remarkable escape, imortalised in the 1964 Hollywood film The Heroes of Telemark, starring Kirk Douglas.\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0,

Please output the summary only, without any other text.\n\nArticle:\nNazir Afzal (above) has resigned from the Crown Prosecution Service despite being cleared of improper conduct. One of the UK's most senior prosecutors dramatically resigned yesterday despite being cleared of improper conduct. Nazir Afzal, who led the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) in North West England, was accused of sending a text message to a defendant. An internal inquiry exonerated the highly experienced lawyer, who was honoured by The Queen in 2005, of any wrongdoing. But he nevertheless handed in his resignation as more senior colleagues insisted his departure is due to an 'on-going drive for efficiency'. The resignation is a direct blow to Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders who has faced criticism for pursing campaign agendas instead of serving the general public. Mr Afzal proved himself to be an outspoken advocate of bringing to justice those accused of the most heinous and sometimes sensitive offences. This included a move to overturn an earlier decision on an Asian Rochdale sex grooming ring that led to a series of convictions. He said that an over-sensitivity to political correctness and 'fear of appearing racist' by 'white professionals' may have stalled justice. More recently he was responsible for the successful conviction of disgraced former BBC presenter Stuart Hall. He also led the prosecutions of Coronation Street actors Bill Roache, who was cleared of rape, and Michael Le Vell, who was also acquitted of child sex abuse. Mr Afzal took up his post in 2011 and led a huge team of about 700 lawyers, legal staff, and administrators. He was responsible for all criminal prosecutions across Greater Manchester, Lancashire, and Cumbria. Earlier this week his staff received an email earlier this week saying it had always been his intention to step down in 2015. Mr Afzal led the prosecutions of Coronation Street actors Bill Roache (left), who was cleared of rape, and Michael Le Vell (right), who was also acquitted of child sex abuse. In the four-line email, Mr Afzal said there was 'no secret reason' why he was leaving after 25 years with the CPS. After studying law in Birmingham, Mr Afzal qualified as a solicitor and worked in private practice until he joined the CPS in 1991. He began his CPS career in central London and has prosecuted and advised on many high profile cases. Mr Afzal was awarded an OBE in the Queen's New Years Honours List in 2005 for his public service and involvement with the local community. A CPS spokesman said: 'We are continuing to reduce the number of staff employed across the organisation and Nazir Afzal is leaving the Service as part of this ongoing drive for efficiency. 'This is entirely unrelated to any issue of conduct and we are satisfied that there has been no impropriety on the part of Mr Afzal.'\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=128, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=False, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: [128000, 9370, 5730, 553, 279, 2768, 3754, 4652, 304, 220, 4386, 11460, 13, 5321, 2612, 279, 12399, 1193, 11, 2085, 904, 1023, 1495, 382, 17064, 512, 94171, 404, 13203, 89, 278, 320, 49532, 8, 706, 40207, 505, 279, 29743, 52270, 1516, 5475, 8994, 1694, 23803, 315, 41086, 6929, 13, 3861, 315, 279, 6560, 596, 1455, 10195, 31920, 29057, 40207, 13985, 8994, 1694, 23803, 315, 41086, 6929, 13, 29874, 404, 13203, 89, 278, 11, 889, 6197, 279, 29743, 52270, 1516, 5475, 320, 34, 5119, 8, 304, 4892, 4410, 9635, 11, 574, 13487, 315, 11889, 264, 1495, 1984, 311, 264, 26884, 13, 1556, 5419, 26981, 506, 27674, 660, 279, 7701, 10534, 15779, 11, 889, 574, 90833, 555, 578, 16657, 304, 220, 1049, 20, 11, 315, 904, 65328, 13, 2030, 568, 38330, 23415, 304, 813, 44734, 439, 810, 10195, 18105, 29676, 813, 25959, 374, 4245, 311, 459, 364, 263, 65912, 6678, 369, 15374, 4527, 578, 44734, 374, 264, 2167, 12523, 311, 10783, 315, 3142, 52270, 4065, 67463, 78317, 889, 706, 17011, 19347, 369, 10037, 287, 4901, 84029, 4619, 315, 13788, 279, 4689, 586, 13, 4491, 13203, 89, 278, 19168, 5678, 311, 387, 459, 70379, 29115, 315, 12967, 311, 12437, 1884, 13487, 315, 279, 1455, 568, 61798, 323, 7170, 16614, 51312, 13, 1115, 5343, 264, 3351, 311, 67687, 459, 6931, 5597, 389, 459, 14875, 36969, 35283, 1877, 75161, 10264, 430, 6197, 311, 264, 4101, 315, 48015, 13, 1283, 1071, 430, 459, 927, 1355, 48937, 311, 5054, 58423, 323, 364, 69, 686, 315, 26449, 25185, 6, 555, 364, 5902, 15749, 6, 1253, 617, 68941, 12437, 13, 4497, 6051, 568, 574, 8647, 369, 279, 6992, 29191, 315, 45286, 4535, 4846, 18588, 34756, 44632, 11166, 13, 1283, 1101, 6197, 279, 98511, 315, 48183, 367, 6825, 20142, 8766, 12093, 1815, 11, 889, 574, 23803, 315, 17199, 11, 323, 8096, 2009, 650, 616, 11, 889, 574, 1101, 91533, 315, 1716, 1877, 11737, 13, 4491, 13203, 89, 278, 3952, 709, 813, 1772, 304, 220, 679, 16, 323, 6197, 264, 6908, 2128, 315, 922, 220, 7007, 21866, 11, 5897, 5687, 11, 323, 38212, 13, 1283, 574, 8647, 369, 682, 9337, 98511, 4028, 33381, 19922, 11, 39634, 97414, 11, 323, 356, 3635, 4298, 13, 47993, 420, 2046, 813, 5687, 4036, 459, 2613, 6931, 420, 2046, 5605, 433, 1047, 2744, 1027, 813, 14944, 311, 3094, 1523, 304, 220, 679, 20, 13, 4491, 13203, 89, 278, 6197, 279, 98511, 315, 48183, 367, 6825, 20142, 8766, 12093, 1815, 320, 2414, 705, 889, 574, 23803, 315, 17199, 11, 323, 8096, 2009, 650, 616, 320, 1315, 705, 889, 574, 1101, 91533, 315, 1716, 1877, 11737, 13, 763, 279, 3116, 8614, 2613, 11, 4491, 13203, 89, 278, 1071, 1070, 574, 364, 2201, 6367, 2944, 6, 3249, 568, 574, 9564, 1306, 220, 914, 1667, 449, 279, 72884, 13, 4740, 21630, 2383, 304, 36937, 11, 4491, 13203, 89, 278, 15337, 439, 264, 30844, 1960, 323, 6575, 304, 879, 6725, 3156, 568, 11096, 279, 72884, 304, 220, 2550, 16, 13, 1283, 6137, 813, 72884, 7076, 304, 8792, 7295, 323, 706, 58559, 323, 26160, 389, 1690, 1579, 5643, 5157, 13, 4491, 13203, 89, 278, 574, 22034, 459, 507, 11855, 304, 279, 16657, 596, 1561, 23116, 16958, 2530, 1796, 304, 220, 1049, 20, 369, 813, 586, 2532, 323, 22315, 449, 279, 2254, 4029, 13, 362, 72884, 18367, 1071, 25, 364, 1687, 527, 14691, 311, 8108, 279, 1396, 315, 5687, 20011, 4028, 279, 22139, 323, 29874, 404, 13203, 89, 278, 374, 9564, 279, 5475, 439, 961, 315, 420, 14529, 6678, 369, 15374, 13, 364, 2028, 374, 11622, 46305, 311, 904, 4360, 315, 6929, 323, 584, 527, 20097, 430, 1070, 706, 1027, 912, 737, 71621, 2676, 389, 279, 961, 315, 4491, 13203, 89, 278, 22438, 19791, 25], prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

A streaming service from HBO, the US network behind Game of Thrones, will launch exclusively on Apple devices, said HBO chief executive, Richard Plepler (pictured) during an Apple special event in California today. Apple said the HBO now service be available through a new channel on Apple TV and on Phones and iPads, at an event in San Francisco today. However, it will only be exclusively available through Apple for three months before moving on to other platforms. New York-based HBO, a unit of Time Warner, has so far been available only to customers with a pay television subscription. The service will be available for iOS devices along with Apple TV set-top box, providing access to shows like Game of Thrones (left) and the Sopranos (right) Price:\xa0It available in the US for $14.99 (£9.90).\xa0The first month is free for early-bird subscribers. Launch date:\xa0April. Devices: \xa0Apple TV and on Phones and iPads from three months exclusively. it will then move on to other web-based systems.

Outside the US, HBO programmes are available through online and pay TV subscription services, such as Sky. The HBO Now service however, is currently only available in the US.\xa0The company has not yet revealed whether HBO Now will be rolled out internationally. With HBO Now, the company is aiming to reach people who have broadband access but don't want to pay for a traditional TV package of dozens of other channels. For the monthly fee, viewers will be able to get HBO content without having to pay for an entire cable package, the company said. The first month is free for early-bird subscribers, the company added. 'This is a transformative moment for HBO,' said chief executive Richard Pepler after an introduction from Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook. The service will ship with the Apple TV in the US, which is now at a lower price of $69 (£45). The price cut is a reaction to devices such as the Google Chromecast having lowered their price to $35 and Roku 2 costing just $70. Time Warner said it wants to push its HBO Now service to the 10 million broadband households that are not subscribed to a cable TV bundle service. It is also targeting the 70 million US cable TV subscribers who aren't HBO subscribers. Outside the US, HBO shows are available through online and pay TV subscription services, such as Sky.

Please output the summary only, without any other text.\n\nArticle:\nThe likes of Brad Pitt, Leonardo DiCaprio, Anne Hathaway and Mila Kunis may be huge Hollywood stars now, but at one point they would have all been struggling actors hoping to get their big break. And for many young actors a job in an advertisement was the best way to make a quick buck whilst they waited for Spielberg to call. Not all jobs in advertising were hugely glamorous, but you've got to pay the rent some how, right? We take a look at the commercials the stars might rather forget... Scroll down for video. Mark Ruffalo was in a Clearasil advert for facial pads in 1989 as a fresh-faced 22-year-old. Mark Ruffalo. Once upon a time, 13 Going on 30 and Shutter Island actor Mark Ruffalo, now 47, played a spotty teen (he was really 22 at the time) running around the streets in a leopard print waistcoat  for Clearasil in 1989. Sporting a curly mop, the 'acne-prone' Ruffalo is distressed with his complexion, and is shown solemnly smearing the Clearasil pads on his face with a deadpan expression. In the next shot, he is back to wreaking havoc on the streets with a cheesy grin. Anne Hathaway. 32-year-old brunette beauty Anne Hathaway may have won an Oscar for her role in Les Misérables, but before Hollywood blockbusters were a regular part of her schedule she was starring in  adverts for regional phone company, Cincinatti Bell. Mid-Nineties Hathaway is seen cringing after a date as she calls her friend on a multi-line phone, while her onscreen mother natters away on another line. In case you were wondering, her 'date' does eventually call. Anne Hathaway was in a TV ad for  internet phone company, Cincinatti Bell, in the late Nineties. This awkward date advert would have come about 15 years before Anne's Oscar success. Leonardo DiCaprio. It might be impossible to imagine the established 40-year-old actor as anything but one of the Hollywood greats, but The Wolf Of Wall Street star used to make his money in bubblegum adverts. With a high-pitched voice, bouncy curtains and a goofy checkered blazer, little 14-year-old Leo is seen popping gum and rocking out in front of a large hi-fi system. Curtain call!\xa0Leonardo DiCaprio at the age of 14 in an advert for Bubble Yum bubblegum in 1988 (left) and now as a 40-year-old. Before his big break, the four-time Oscar-nominated actor used to advertise gum. Naomi Watts. Almost unrecognisable sporting an uncontrollable perm, the Mulholland Drive and King Kong actress Naomi Watts starred in an Australian advert for Tampax tampons in the Eighties. She awkwardly deals with an array of puberty difficulties: her bothersome younger brother, her irritated complexion, but according to the advert, one thing that doesn't bother her is her 'time of month'. Naomi would have been about 16 at the time that this advert came out. Cue tons of cheesy grins and wide collar suits from a now 46-year-old Naomi Watts. Check out that perm! Naomi Watts starred in a tampon commercial for Tampax in the 1980s. The clip features tons of Eighties\xa0clichés including hair bows and wide-collar suits. Brad Pitt. Before he became a hot commodity in Hollywood and one half of the power couple that is 'Brangelina', Brad Pitt, now 51, was out patrolling the streets looking for Pringle-popping ladies to impress, or so this commercial shows. Brad sports a golden tan and cavorts with his 'jock' friends in a yellow convertible; he would have been about 25 years of age. With no dialogue, Brad can only showcase his acting prowess by munching the crisps in a ecstatic manner. Brad Pitt featured in a cheesy advert for Pringles crisps in 1988. He is one of three topless men in the video. The famous Hollywood actor would have been just 25-years-old at the time and still trying to catch his lucky break. Sarah Michelle Gellar. She may be widely recognised as stake-toting high-kicking Buffy the vampire slayer, but 38-year-old Sarah Michelle Gellar started her career as a child actor, and starred in Burger King's first ever televised advert in 1981. Pictured in sweet lavender dungarees and ribbon-held bunches, four-year-old Gellar sits on a picnic bench in an idyllic town and weighs up Burger King's benefits against McDonald's disadvantages. In a endearing voice she pips: 'I go to Burger King!' Fast-food slayer Sarah Michelle Gellar in a Burger King in 1981 at only four years old. Bryan Cranston. Considering his now-legendary  status following a starring role in Breaking Bad (he counts stars like Rihanna and Keith Richards as fans), Bryan Cranston's Eighties hemorrhoids advert is certainly one of the most embarrassing. Cranston, now 59, walks up to the camera in a retro suit and holds up a tub of hemorrhoid cream, raving about 'hemorrhoidal tissue' and the cream's beneficial qualities. In the early 1980s Bryan Cranston starred in a commercial for a hemorrhoid cream Preparation H  around 25 years or so before Breaking Bad success. Demi Moore. Before 52-year-old Ghost actress Demi Moore had the Hollywood body everyone aspired to achieve, she starred as a less polished youth in sultry Coca Cola adverts. With soft jazz music playing, a shoulder-padded Demi has an almost fatal incident with a Diet Coke can, but which ultimately leads her to meeting a handsome gentleman. Demi would have been about 26 years old at the time. Actress Demi Moore featured in a Diet Coke commercial in 1988. Ben Affleck. Now a  twice Oscar-winning actor/director, 42-year-old Ben Affleck has certainly come a long way since his fast-food days. The advert shows Affleck sporting a bouncy quiff, bomber jacket and bleached denim, patrolling the streets in a car with a vintage in-built phone. The actor would have only been about 17 at the time. A few cheesy hair-grooming moments and a case of mistaken identity later and he's picking up a Burger King Chef Salad for his female interest. But before long is  called home by his dad for his curfew. Embarassing. In 1989 Ben Affleck was in a Burger King commercial. He would have been about 17 at the time. Bruce Willis. It's hard to imagine 60-year-old Die Hard actor Bruce Willis shimmying down the street in a white baggy suit with three supermodels, but in the late Nineties his advert for Seagram's Wine Coolers tells a different story. The actor would have been around 32 years of age and is pictured playfully skipping and twirling with the ladies. He is eventually seen sporting a sleeveless t-shirt and enthusiastically playing the harmonica. Before his action-packed glory days, Bruce Willis made his name in an advert for Seagram's Wine Coolers in 1987. This was about a year before he appeared in his career-making lead role in Die Hard. Mila Kunis. Four years before Mila Kunis, now 31, got her big break in  sitcom That '70s Show, and several years before she was crowned FHM's Sexiest Woman Alive, she was just another girl who liked to play with dolls - and starred in an advert for Glitter Hair Barbie in 1994. 11-year-old Mila is seen fresh-faced with a plait in her long hair, sporting a pink turtleneck and excitedly gazing at the doll that can have glitter combed into its locks. Mila Who-nis? Mila Kunis used to star in commercials such as this one for Glitter Hair Barbie in 1994, when she was about 11 years old.\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0,

Please output the summary only, without any other text.\n\nArticle:\nA controversial Spanish dolphin trainer who was coming to the US to work at the\xa0Georgia Aquarium in Atlanta has gone missing. Jose Luis Barbero, 59, can allegedly be seen hitting and kicking dolphins in videos that caught the attention of animal protection groups, but he was still hired as a vice president at the aquarium. The aquarium's newest hire, who was working on the resort island of Mallorca\xa0in the Mediterranean Sea off the coast of Spain, has vanished. Scroll down for video. Dolphin trainer Jose Luis Barbero, who was just hired by the Georgia Aquarium in Atlanta, has gone missing. Before he vanished, videos of Barbero, 59, (rear) allegedly hitting and kicking dolphins surfaced on the internet. After the videos (pictured above) started popping up on the web,\xa0Barbero began receiving death threats. Barbero went missing before another video  accusing him of abusing dolphins\xa0was released yesterday, according to\xa011 Alive. He was last seen on Tuesday leaving his home, WSB TV reported. Balearic Islands emergency services are continuing to search for him. Georgia Aquarium CEO Mike Leven said, 'We are very concerned. 'We hope he turns up soon and that everything is all right. Our thoughts are with him and his family.' According to Leven, Barbero received death threats after the videos surfaced. The embattled trainer did respond to the videos on Facebook. In a translated post he said: 'I believe a response is needed to this brutal and cowardly campaign against my profession. 'I can only say from my lawyers' recommendations that this video is a montage created to provoke a campaign challenging my professionalism over 35 years.' A former FBI agent was also hired by the Georgia Aquarium to travel to Spain as part of the investigation. Barbero of Spain went missing before another video accusing him of abusing dolphins was released yesterday. The most recent video\xa0allegedly shows Barbero being aggressive towards dolphins during a training session at a theme park in Spain. Animal advocacy group SOSdelfines said the videos are'meant to show how captive dolphins are treated', according to the Dodo. The aquarium has questioned whether the videos of Barbero are authentic and used the terms 'extremely questionable' and 'crudely edited' to describe them. Aquarium leaders claimed to have 'thoroughly reviewed and vetted'\xa0Barbero as a candidate and also cited that he has\xa035 years of professional experience. Experts were brought in to analyze the content of the videos. A former FBI agent was also hired by the aquarium to travel to Spain as part of the investigation. It is unclear what\xa0Barbero's job status is at the  moment, but he it appears he is still a consultant and not a full-time employee of the aquarium. The Georgia Aquarium maintains that it has a\xa0zero tolerance policy against the mistreatment of animals. Animal advocacy group SOSdelfines said the videos are'meant to show how captive dolphins are treated' The aquarium released a statement about the Barbero\xa0investigation on Friday afternoon. It said: 'Our search for truth into the allegations against Jose Luis Barbero continues. 'Until our investigation is complete, we will not make any decisions regarding his employment, so at this time, Mr. Barbero remains in Spain. 'We are committed to making decisions based on factual information and very thorough analysis. 'We have a zero tolerance policy against the mistreatment of animals and continue to investigate every aspect of this matter. 'We appreciate your patience and support as we sort through this difficult situation.' It seems that Barbero is still a consultant and not a full-time employee of the aquarium at this time.\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0,

The Harlequins openside was understandably disappointed not to get his hands on the trophy after an extraordinary final day as the Red Rose fell six points short of the required total, despite beating France 55-35 at Twickenham on Saturday evening. Instead it was Ireland who retained the title, with their 40-10 triumph over Scotland enough to overhaul a tough target set by Wales with their 61-20 win over Italy on what is already being touted as the greatest day in the competition's history. A dejected Chris Robshaw leaves the field at Twickenham having given it his all against France - he has since said he is 'devastated' with second place in the Six Nations championship. Robshaw is left devastated after his side ended up being RBS 6 Nations runners-up against despite France win. England flanker Robshaw and France flanker Thierry Dusautoir speak with referee Nigel Owens. Robshaw shakes hands with Referee Owens  at the end of the RBS Six Nations match  at Twickenham Stadium. Such plaudits mean little to Robshaw, who is now determined to use the disappointment as fuel for a tilt at the World Cup on home soil later this year. 'I am devastated,' Robshaw told several national newspapers. 'Once again to fall short on points is tough to take. We went out and gave it our all but unfortunately came up short again.' Scott Spedding is tackled by Jonathan Joseph during the RBS Six Nations match at Twickenham Stadium. Bernard Le Roux is tackled by Luther Burrell during the RBS Six Nations match between England and France. Jules Plisson, Robshaw, Loann Goujon and Luther Burrell all challenge for the ball at Twickenham. The back-rower was at pains to point out that it was not the failure to get the 26-point victory they needed against France that was the most costly factor in their doomed bid for the northern hemisphere crown. 'It didn't come down to this game,' he added. 'If we'd been more clinical and taken more points against Scotland and been better defensively against Italy it would have been different. 'We are not where we want to be. We want to be champions. But to score 50 points against France, considering they had only conceded two tries all tournament, was a great scoreline and really showed our intent.' Billy Vunipola is tackled by the French defence during the RBS Six Nations match at Twickenham Stadium. Courtney Lawes is helped up by Benjamin Kayser at the end of the RBS Six Nations match. With England the host nation at this autumn's tussle for the Webb Ellis Cup, the Twickenham support could make a huge difference to their bid and Robshaw was quick to praise the fans for their efforts at the weekend. 'I think it was the loudest I have ever heard Twickenham - the place was rocking and that is what we want,' he said. 'We are playing very well at home and have built a lot of momentum now and if you look at where our World Cup games are, they are back here.'\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=128, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=False, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: [128000, 9370, 5730, 553, 279, 2768, 3754, 4652, 304, 220, 4386, 11460, 13, 5321, 2612, 279, 12399, 1193, 11, 2085, 904, 1023, 1495, 382, 17064, 512, 67308, 24862, 11517, 4997, 51104, 374, 364, 3667, 561, 660, 6, 1306, 813, 3185, 9670, 709, 1694, 432, 7497, 220, 21, 19687, 39380, 5352, 220, 520, 279, 9178, 13, 578, 5340, 273, 447, 1354, 16264, 579, 574, 88098, 25406, 539, 311, 636, 813, 6206, 389, 279, 38782, 1306, 459, 24674, 1620, 1938, 439, 279, 3816, 16344, 11299, 4848, 3585, 2875, 315, 279, 2631, 2860, 11, 8994, 27242, 9822, 220, 2131, 12, 1758, 520, 12015, 9890, 5721, 389, 7884, 11714, 13, 12361, 433, 574, 14990, 889, 35363, 279, 2316, 11, 449, 872, 220, 1272, 12, 605, 38586, 927, 19627, 3403, 311, 52774, 264, 11292, 2218, 743, 555, 23782, 449, 872, 220, 5547, 12, 508, 3243, 927, 15704, 389, 1148, 374, 2736, 1694, 67528, 439, 279, 12474, 1938, 304, 279, 10937, 596, 3925, 13, 362, 409, 29403, 11517, 4997, 51104, 11141, 279, 2115, 520, 12015, 9890, 5721, 3515, 2728, 433, 813, 682, 2403, 9822, 482, 568, 706, 2533, 1071, 568, 374, 364, 3667, 561, 660, 6, 449, 2132, 2035, 304, 279, 19198, 19687, 22279, 13, 4997, 51104, 374, 2163, 59097, 1306, 813, 3185, 9670, 709, 1694, 432, 7497, 220, 21, 19687, 39380, 5352, 2403, 8994, 9822, 3243, 13, 9635, 70592, 261, 4997, 51104, 323, 9822, 70592, 261, 60223, 5515, 423, 355, 3989, 404, 6604, 449, 55302, 66916, 64457, 13, 4997, 51104, 63130, 6206, 449, 8718, 76060, 64457, 220, 520, 279, 842, 315, 279, 432, 7497, 19198, 19687, 2489, 220, 520, 12015, 9890, 5721, 23462, 13, 15483, 628, 8039, 1220, 3152, 2697, 311, 4997, 51104, 11, 889, 374, 1457, 11075, 311, 1005, 279, 41698, 439, 10633, 369, 264, 37300, 520, 279, 4435, 11098, 389, 2162, 17614, 3010, 420, 1060, 13, 364, 40, 1097, 59097, 2965, 4997, 51104, 3309, 3892, 5426, 32594, 13, 364, 12805, 1578, 311, 4498, 2875, 389, 3585, 374, 11292, 311, 1935, 13, 1226, 4024, 704, 323, 6688, 433, 1057, 682, 719, 26907, 3782, 709, 2875, 1578, 3238, 10016, 3165, 291, 7113, 374, 82457, 555, 24150, 15466, 2391, 279, 432, 7497, 19198, 19687, 2489, 520, 12015, 9890, 5721, 23462, 13, 35352, 2009, 29622, 87, 374, 82457, 555, 36302, 426, 852, 657, 2391, 279, 432, 7497, 19198, 19687, 2489, 1990, 9635, 323, 9822, 13, 622, 2482, 1856, 49363, 11, 4997, 51104, 11, 6621, 1036, 480, 283, 35265, 323, 36302, 426, 852, 657, 682, 8815, 369, 279, 5041, 520, 12015, 9890, 5721, 13, 578, 1203, 20115, 261, 574, 520, 51266, 311, 1486, 704, 430, 433, 574, 539, 279, 8060, 311, 636, 279, 220, 1627, 16983, 12845, 814, 4460, 2403, 9822, 430, 574, 279, 1455, 34348, 8331, 304, 872, 58737, 14435, 369, 279, 18671, 69766, 27631, 13, 364, 2181, 3287, 956, 2586, 1523, 311, 420, 1847, 2965, 568, 3779, 13, 364, 2746, 584, 4265, 1027, 810, 14830, 323, 4529, 810, 3585, 2403, 19627, 323, 1027, 2731, 83080, 2403, 15704, 433, 1053, 617, 1027, 2204, 13, 364, 1687, 527, 539, 1405, 584, 1390, 311, 387, 13, 1226, 1390, 311, 387, 34838, 13, 2030, 311, 5573, 220, 1135, 3585, 2403, 9822, 11, 13126, 814, 1047, 1193, 62687, 1403, 16696, 682, 16520, 11, 574, 264, 2294, 5573, 1074, 323, 2216, 8710, 1057, 7537, 3238, 33919, 650, 359, 575, 8083, 374, 82457, 555, 279, 8753, 23682, 2391, 279, 432, 7497, 19198, 19687, 2489, 520, 12015, 9890, 5721, 23462, 13, 71782, 7658, 288, 374, 9087, 709, 555, 30411, 31245, 805, 520, 279, 842, 315, 279, 432, 7497, 19198, 19687, 2489, 13, 3161, 9635, 279, 3552, 7140, 520, 420, 42774, 596, 259, 1892, 273, 369, 279, 55488, 44707, 11098, 11, 279, 12015, 9890, 5721, 1862, 1436, 1304, 264, 6908, 6811, 311, 872, 14435, 323, 4997, 51104, 574, 4062, 311, 29488, 279, 7359, 369, 872, 9045, 520, 279, 9178, 13, 364, 40, 1781, 433, 574, 279, 29740, 5086, 358, 617, 3596, 6755, 12015, 9890, 5721, 482, 279, 2035, 574, 67724, 323, 430, 374, 1148, 584, 1390, 2965, 568, 1071, 13, 364, 1687, 527, 5737, 1633, 1664, 520, 2162, 323, 617, 5918, 264, 2763, 315, 24151, 1457, 323, 422, 499, 1427, 520, 1405, 1057, 4435, 11098, 3953, 527, 11, 814, 527, 1203, 1618, 22438, 19791, 25], prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

Please output the summary only, without any other text.\n\nArticle:\nA man who allegedly made bombs for a terrorist group responsible for a string of attacks in New York more than 40-years ago has been revealed\xa0to be living in leafy suburbia as a high school teacher. Ronald Fliegelman is said to have built explosives for the far-left group Weather Underground who ran a terrifying campaign across the country during the 1970s. But according to a new book seen byThe New York Post,\xa0after avoiding prison on a technicality he managed to build a successful, 25-year career in the classroom after the group disbanded - and still hasn't served a day in prison. Ronald Fliegelman built explosives for the far-left group Weather Underground who ran a terrifying campaign across the country during the 1970s. Firefighters work at extinguishing the fire at a residence in Greenwich Village on March 6, 1970. Three members of the Weather Underground were killed when a bomb went off prematurely. Bryan Burrough's book, Days of Rage: America's Radical Underground, the FBI, and the Forgotten Age of Revolutionary Violence, states Fliegelman is now living a quiet life in Park Slope in Brooklyn after retiring. But the author, who also penned the books Public Enemies about America's crime wave in the 1930s and 40s, say's the culprit is not sorry for what he has done. Burroughs told The Post: 'Ron is proud of what he did.' The Weathermen, as they were popularly known, was set up in 1969 and run by the co-founder Bill Ayers. He went on to become a University of Chicago professor and his friendship with Barack Obama was questioned during the 2008 race for the White House. The Weathermen, as they were popularly known, was set up in 1969 and run by the co-founder Bill Ayers (pictured in 2013) The group was  mostly of white and middle class and advocated the overthrow of the US government. Their name was based on the Bob Dylan lyric: 'You don't need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows.' In 1970 they waged they issued a 'Declaration of a State of War' against the United States. The same year a bomb exploded inside a Greenwich Village, New York, residence prematurely, killing three members. They also staged attacks on the Capitol Building in Washington D.C after the invasion of Laos in 1971, and targeted the New York Department of Corrections building in Albany after 29 inmates died during the Attica prison riot the same year. According to The Post one of the Weathermen told Burroughs: 'We believed Third World countries would rise up and cause crises that would bring down the industrialized West, and we believed it was going to happen tomorrow, or maybe the day after tomorrow.' Former group member Howie Machtinger added: 'The myth, and this is always Bill Ayers’ line, is that Weather never set out to kill people, and it’s not true — we did. 'You know, policemen were fair game.' The New York Post approached Fliegelman in leafy Park Slope and asked him about his past. 'What happened 40 years ago is different from what’s going on today. War was a big thing. It was on TV every night. You don’t know that with the Iraqi war, the Afghanistan war. There was the draft, as well,' said Fliegelman. When it was put to the 70-year-old that he was a not a freedom fighter but a terrorist, he reportedly disagreed. 'Did you ever notice how many people were hurt by our bombs? People were not hurt by our bombs,' said Fliegelman. Bryan Burrough's (right) book, Days of Rage: America's Radical Underground, the FBI, and the Forgotten Age of Revolutionary Violence claims the teacher is now living a quiet life in Park Slope, Brooklyn.\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[],

Please output the summary only, without any other text.\n\nArticle:\nFive years ago England beat Spain to win the Under 17 European Championships. The winning goal came from a striker who burst powerfully into the box, between two opponents, before firing home a sweet shot into the corner beyond the keeper. A cool finish on a big occasion. A few months later, I saw him come on as a substitute in the Championship and display some clever touches and neat footwork. He stood out as one of the more technically gifted players on display in the second tier game. Fast forward a few more months and that teenage striker - playing in the Championship - picked up the ball in his own half, ran towards the opposition goal, beat two defenders, wrong-footed the keeper and slotted into an empty net. Connor Wickham made a disastrous decision to move to Sunderland when his career was flying. In the Championship, he impressed and looked like one of the most technically gifted players on the pitch. Two weeks after that he scored a hat-trick. In the summer of 2011 he made what has proved to be a catastrophic career move. He signed for Sunderland. To those who didn't follow Connor Wickham's career before he went to the North-East, all they will know of him is that he is highly-paid, and not exactly outstanding. Sure, there was a flurry of goals to help Sunderland stay up at the back end of last season, but that has been it. Stories emerged last season of his big spending - £17,500 on a gold bottle of champagne, and a £140,000 Ferrari. These barely make a dent in his £60,000-a-week salary, and they look cheap compared with team-mate Steven Fletcher and his £260,000 Lamborghini parked next to his £160,000 Bentley. These underachieving Sunderland players don't mind showing off their wealth, do they? Stories have emerged of Wickham's extravagant spending - £17,500 on a bottle of champagne, for example. In a loan spell at Sheffield Wednesday, he also impressed - there is no mistaking his ability as a footballer. Is it something about the club that means these players have no self-awareness whatsoever? Is nobody at the club telling them that all the time they're so truly terrible on the pitch, it might be a good idea to keep things on the down low off the pitch? One of Wickham's managers called him 'a playboy model,' and said he needed a'slap in the face' to help him realise his talent. And make no mistake, Wickham is a very talented footballer. Unfortunately he chose the wrong club. Since Wickham joined Sunderland he has had 10 different managers at club level, including his loan spells. That is not the ideal environment for young talent to be nurtured and flourish. Managers come and go so quickly that the pressure for immediate results is huge, so the time a manager can devote to individual players on and off the pitch is restricted. Wickham should be spearheading England Under 21s' Euro campaign but he has not been selected. The 21-year-old has been stuck out on the left for Sunderland when he is clearly a centre-forward. At a more stable club, the chances are that Wickham might have a better environment to succeed. On the pitch he has been stuck out on the left when he is obviously a centre forward. That's where he did so well at the end of last season. Off the pitch, has the so-called 'playboy model' been guided properly? Evidence suggests not: Gus Poyet even admitted he ignored Wickham when he first arrived at the Stadium of Light as manager. He revealed he didn't even sit down and talk to the player. Sunderland signed Wickham but their duty doesn't stop there. They need to provide that player with every chance to succeed. Hopefully stability will reign at the Stadium of Light in the near future, Wickham will get the right guidance off the field, and he will be allowed to play to his strengths on the field. Sunderland need to provide their players with a chance to succeed but Wickham has not been guided. Sunderland are a basket case of a club and Wickham made the wrong decision when he joined them. Five years on from scoring a wonderful goal to win the European Championship for England I am disappointed Wickham is nowhere near the senior squad as we prepare for a Euro 2016 qualifier this week. Even more worrying, repeated pull-outs from the Under 21 squads mean he's way down the pecking order, even with injuries this week. He should be spearheading our charge to the Euros in the Czech Republic this summer. The ongoing debate about English talent failing to develop after promising early signs needs to look at examples like Wickham. All the ability, but no significant strides made. He should have made that progression. The fact that he hasn't is down to Sunderland being a complete basket case of a club. Let's hope for Wickham's sake – and England's – the next chapter for Sunderland will help him become the player he should be.\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0,

Please output the summary only, without any other text.\n\nArticle:\nHer feisty passion helped make Poldark one of the biggest TV phenomena of the 1970s, changing the face of period drama for ever and making sex symbols of its stars. But while the beautiful and headstrong leading lady Demelza won over millions of fans, one man was furious with the depiction: Poldark's original creator Winston Graham. The author was 'livid' with the way the BBC portrayed the impulsive servant from his series of historical novels as promiscuous, and wanted the show pulled from the screens. Anthony Robin Ellis as Captain Ross Poldark and Angharad Rees as Demelza in\xa0one of the biggest TV phenomena of the 1970s,\xa0Poldark. Demelza was memorably played by flame-haired Angharad Rees. Graham's daughter Rosamund Barteau made the revelation to The Mail on Sunday, as a much-anticipated remake starts tonight. 'Father blew a gasket when he saw the first episode of the original series,' she says. 'He was so angry about the way they had changed Demelza into a floozy that he wanted to get the production halted. 'He was absolutely livid. In the novel she was a spirited tomboy, but the producers had some salacious need to make her sexually loose. Poldark's original creator Winston Graham  was furious with the depiction of character Demelza, pictured is the author's wife Jean Graham. 'In one scene she even offered to pull down her knickers for a shilling. That certainly was not in the books. 'Father, fearing the other episodes would be more like a bad romance novel, tried everything he could to stop the show from airing. But he did not have any editorial control. 'It was not until the second series that he was able to have any input.' But Graham came to embrace the show, which was a runaway success on both sides of the Atlantic. Rosamund – who now lives in Idaho after marrying an American – cannot remember a time when Poldark was not a part of her life. 'As a child I knew it was important not to play too loudly, when dad was locked in his study,' she recalls. 'We lived in a lovely Cornish village and at those times I usually took myself off to my friend's house. 'Father woke up early, went into his study and wrote something every day. And every afternoon would have tea with my mother for an hour, when he would bounce ideas at her.' Remake:\xa0The new version casts heart-throb Aidan Turner in the lead role of Captain Ross Poldark, originally played by Robin Ellis. 'Father was the author, but she helped with some of the details because she was very observant. 'She saw everything and remembered it all. She had an eye for detail and could help my father with his writing. She had the most amazing sense of humour, too. Rosamund Barteau is keeping her father's creation alive – by running a Poldark-themed guesthouse in Idaho. The bedrooms, arranged around a central swimming pool, are named after the story's four main characters. 'Americans love themed vacations, and Poldark was a hit on US TV and sold well on video,' she says. 'It has a good following in the States.' 'I was in my late teens when I was old enough to read my father's novels. I am very pleased that they have stood the test of time and a new generation will be able to enjoy the series – and the books.' The new version casts heart-throb Aidan Turner in the lead role of Captain Ross Poldark, originally played by Robin Ellis. He returns from the American War of Independence to find his father dead, his house wrecked and his sweetheart engaged. His romance with Demelza, played by Eleanor Tomlinson, is again at the heart of the series. 'I've seen the first episode with Aidan and I could sit and watch it again and again,' says Rosamund. 'I think my dad would be very proud of what the BBC have done. Eleanor's Demelza is wonderful and her Cornish accent is good. It isn't too strong but enough to know where she is supposed to be from.'\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0,

Please output the summary only, without any other text.\n\nArticle:\nFor many women, being mistaken for a celebrity is the ultimate compliment. But for Sabrina May, who was compared to Gemma Collins, it only made her cringe. Every time that Sabrina from Essex was out in public, she would be mistaken for the The Only Way Is Essex star. In fact, one night somebody even asked the size 22 florist for her autograph. After five years of this unwanted stardom, Sabrina decided that it was time to make a change to her appearance - and she lost seven stone and slimmed down to a size 10 as a result. Scroll down for video. Sabrina May, 29, used to be mistaken for TOWIE star Gemma Collins before she lost seven stone in weight. Sabrina, 29, who at her heaviest was 16st 12lb, said: 'I've always been a TOWIE fan and thought Gemma was great. 'We were both big, bubbly, blonde Essex girls with a love of pie and chips and cocktails. However, I still never thought I was as big as her. 'I was kidding myself about my weight. I was genuinely surprised and gutted when people started mistaking me for her. 'When I was asked to sign the autograph I knew it was time to change - it was the wake-up call I needed.' Sabrina, who at her heaviest was 16st 12lb, left, was even asked for her autograph when someone mistook her for Gemma Collins but she went on to shed the pounds on a health kick, right, and is now a size 10. Sabrina admits her whole family would sit down and tuck into giant home-cooked dinners, which left them all feeling overweight. Every time that Sabrina from Essex was out in public, she would be mistaken for the The Only Way Is Essex star Gemma Collins, right. Sabrina says she began putting on weight in her early twenties when her lifestyle changed after leaving college. The mother-of-one, from Chelmsford, said: 'I stopped being so active when I was a student.' And she admits her whole family would sit down and tuck into giant home-cooked dinners, which left them all feeling overweight. Sabrina said: 'My father Paul was a big guy who loved his food. He used to say life was too short for dieting and to just have what you enjoyed. But unfortunately, when he was 26st, he died. 'Of course, we all knew that at his weight he wasn't the healthiest but we had no idea just how serious it was.' After losing her father, who was overweight, she was  terrified that her own weight might take her away from her own son so she decided to do something about it. She heard about the Terri-Ann 123 diet plan on Facebook and liked the fact it gave her 24-hour access to online support with other slimmers so she signed up. In January 2012, Paul was taken to hospital but medics struggled to diagnose his condition. Just ten days later he died of multiple organ failure and doctors confirmed that his weight had played a part. Sabrina said: 'He was just too unhealthy and his size made him hard to treat. 'I was lost without him and terrified that my own weight might take me away from my son. I didn't want to put him through what I was going through losing dad. 'I knew I didn't want to leave my Taylor, who is now three, without a mum.' The plan also allowed her to eat lots of her favourite foods, but cooked in different ways. They are always served without carbohydrates. Sabrina also made sure she visited the gym and the weight soon started to drop off. She vowed to ditch the chips and get slim but her grief always led her back to the fridge. And unfortunately for Sabrina, she loved unhealthy foods and would feast on large bowls of pasta, crisps, wine and chocolate. Her weight rocketed when she fell pregnant with Tyler in 2010, and she remained a size 22 after he was born. Sabrina said: 'I would live on milky coffee all day telling myself I was being healthy. 'But at night, when my son was in bed, I would binge eat anything and everything I could get my hands on. 'It never seemed odd to me because all my family loved food. I still made an effort with my hair and make-up and wore smart clothes, so I thought I looked OK.' Before she lost weight, Sabrina loved unhealthy foods and would feast on large bowls of pasta, crisps, wine and chocolate and never used the gym. Her weight rocketed when she fell pregnant with Tyler in 2010, and she remained a size 22 after he was born. Like a lot of people trying conventional diets, Sabrina found she was back to the fatty foods within a month. A year later, when she went out with friends to her favourite Essex haunt, she was asked to sign the autograph and decided enough was enough. Sabrina said: 'I just laughed it off and made a joke of it but inside I was mortified and vowed I would diet.' She heard about the Terri-Ann 123 diet plan on Facebook and liked the fact it gave her 24-hour access to online support with other slimmers. As a single mother, the one-off payment appealed too - so she signed up in April 2013. In the first ten days Sabrina lost a stone and says the motivation to continue came from the Facebook page, which she could log on to for support night and day. After she started weightlifting at the gym, she began to see results on her stomach. Sabrina says it used to flap around, but it is now smooth and toned. The plan also allowed her to eat lots of her favourite foods, but cooked in different ways. They are always served without carbohydrates. Sabrina says: 'I had a cooked breakfast every day and enjoyed big lunches and dinner. To be honest, I was probably eating more than I had been when I was fat.' Four months in and she had already dropped 4st and was a size 16. She said: 'I was thrilled but I still looked like Gemma so I wanted to keep going, especially because my tummy was still massive.' In December 2013, Sabrina started working out at a gym to boost her weight loss and tone up. And finally, after she started weightlifting at the gym, she began to see results on her stomach. Sabrina says it used to flap around, but it is now smooth and toned. Within 13 months she had dropped down to 9st 12lb and is now a size ten. Sabrina still works the Essex look, but has not been mistaken for Gemma since she started losing weight. She added: 'I still love Gemma but I'm pleased that I don't get mistaken for her any more.'\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0,

Please output the summary only, without any other text.\n\nArticle:\nFacebook is to begin supporting virtual reality on its newsfeed, with users able to put on a VR headset and explore a virtual location. The social network announced that users will be able to view videos filmed with multiple cameras, and move the viewpoint in order to explore a location. The innovation is being showcased at the firm's F8 developers' conference in San Francisco under the name Teleportation Station - a name that was leaked via an app notification this morning. Scroll down to see a 360 degree video. Facebook is hosting two-day developers' conference F8, where Mrk Zuckerberg revealed its VR plans. The company is demonstrating the new video format for attendees at this week's F8 conference by showing off a 24-camera-view of the Facebook headquarters in Menlo Park, California. On a desktop computer, it is controlled by a mouse. 'You're going to be able to put on your Oculus headset,' Zuckerberg said, 'and view spherical videos there too.' The  videos are shot with twenty-four cameras working in parallel. 'You can move around inside the video,' Mark Zuckerberg said, 'and view it from different angles.' The company is demonstrating the new video format for attendees at this week's F8 conference by showing off a 24-camera-view of the Facebook headquarters in Menlo Park, California. On a desktop computer, it is controlled by a mouse. However, \xa0the company describes its spherical videos as a 'first step' toward even more immersive videos that we'll view through virtual reality headsets like the Oculus Rift, which straps over your eyes and provide the illusion of stepping inside a digital environment. 'You're going to be able to put on your Oculus headset,' Zuckerberg said, 'and view spherical videos there too.' He also announced that users will soon be able to share content from third-party apps in their Messenger - Facebook's instant messaging service. 'One of the fastest growing and most important members of our family is Messenger,' said Mr Zuckerberg. 'Facebook used to be this single blue app and it did a lot of different things, now Facebook is a family of apps,' he said. 'Moving from being a single service to a family of apps is the biggest shift we've made in our strategy in helping connect people.' The Messenger Platform was also launched, allowing developers to build new services into the app, which is used by 600 million users each month. Mr Zuckerberg said it would give users'more tools for expression'. The new Platform will give users the chance to communicate directly with businesses, for example to change an order as well as track its delivery. The move will allow users to see 360 degree videos using the Oculus Rift headset (pictured) Facebook's David Marcus, vice president of messaging products, took to the stage to confirm that apps like ESPN have already built apps that will now be supported in Messenger. Over 40 apps will be launched in the coming days, he confirmed. The initial kit for developers to build their software into Messenger will be available from today, though no general release date has yet been confirmed. Mr Marcus also spoke of Facebook's desire to revolutionise online shopping by allowing users to receive real-time shopping updates via Messenger. This will start a message thread with the brand a user has shopped with, so they can track and alter an order via an instant message conversation. Users can then send a thumbs-up to confirm an order. It will begin rolling out in the 'next few weeks', according to Mr Marcus. 'It's time for us to reinvent how people and business communicate,' he said. Ilya Sukhar, from the social media site's Parse department, the area of Facebook made for developers, also announced that the social network will begin supporting software development kits (SDKs) for the 'internet of things'. This is the idea that all a person's smart devices can be connected together, enabling developers to create apps for Facebook that can control part of the home. Facebook is trying to mould its Messenger app into a more versatile communications channel as smartphones create new ways for people to connect with friends and businesses beyond the walls of the company's ubiquitous social network. To pull it off, Facebook is opening Messenger so outside programmers can build features tailored for the service. Messenger will also be adding the ability to display store receipts and shipping information to help consumers keep track of their interactions with merchants and other businesses. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg touted the Messenger expansion Wednesday during his opening speech at a two-day conference for developers in San Francisco. The push to plant more features in Messenger underscores the growing importance of apps that enable more intimate and direct conversations than social networks. The example of receiving a notification when a garage door is opened was demonstrated on-stage. The F8 developers' conference, which is being attended by more than 3,000 Facebook app developers, is the social network's only major live show of the year. The company, which has more than 1.3 billion monthly users, also unveiled a range of new tools for advertisers, including new analytics tools to monitor ad campaigns. 'All of you are the ones building the services that are unleashing this new wave of expression,' said Mr Zuckerberg, as he returned to the stage. 'It's really our honour to serve you and to be on this journey together. Let's go connect the world,' he said.\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0,

Please output the summary only, without any other text.\n\nArticle:\n(CNN)Two days after Odin Lloyd was found dead, New England Patriots star Aaron Hernandez looked into the eyes of team owner Robert Kraft and said he was innocent, Kraft testified Tuesday in Hernandez\'s murder trial. Kraft, answering questions from a prosecutor and one of Hernandez\'s attorneys on the witness stand in a Massachusetts courtroom, recalled a private conversation that he had with the star Patriots tight end on June 19, at the Patriots\' Gillette Stadium, as news spread that Hernandez was being investigated in Lloyd\'s death. "He said he was not involved," Kraft testified in the courtroom in Fall River. "He said he was innocent." Hernandez has been charged with murder and has pleaded not guilty to orchestrating the death of Lloyd, a semipro football player who was found dead in Massachusetts on June 17, 2013. Hernandez also has pleaded not guilty to a gun and ammunition charge. His co-defendants, Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz, also pleaded not guilty and will be tried separately. Kraft testified that he asked to speak with Hernandez in an office near a weight room in the stadium, and asked the player to look him in the eye and tell him if he was involved in Lloyd\'s death. According to Kraft, Hernandez told him during that meeting that he hoped the time of Lloyd\'s death "came out," because Hernandez had been at a club that night. According to testimony from Hernandez\'s fiancée, Shayanna Jenkins, the player had not been at a club, but was at dinner with her and some friends before the shooting. Mel Robbins, a CNN legal analyst, called Kraft\'s testimony "explosive." "What a great, great witness for the prosecution," she said. "Basically what happened is Aaron Hernandez lied to his boss. And the only way you rebut it is if you put him on the stand." How did Hernandez know when the murder happened, Robbins asked, unless he was there? The Patriots\' owner also testified, when asked by a defense attorney, that he\'d never had any problems with Hernandez, and that the player was always respectful to him. The billionaire magnate of The Kraft Group, a company with interests ranging from paper and packaging concerns to sports and entertainment, said Hernandez always greeted him with a hug and kiss. Asked by the defense why Hernandez was signed to a $40 million long-term contract, Kraft said simply: "He\'s a very good player." At times during his 30 minutes or so on the witness stand, Kraft seemed uncomfortable. "Do you work?" Bristol County District Attorney William McCauley asked Kraft. "I think so, yes." Asked where he worked, Kraft responded, 1 Patriot Place, or Gillette Stadium, where the Super Bowl champions play their home games. "What do you do for work?" "Whatever they ask me to do." Outside court, surrounded by cameras, Kraft expressed sadness over Lloyd\'s death. "A man died," he said. "This is about a man being killed. It\'s unfortunate." Later, Mark Briggs, head of security at Gillette Stadium, testified that he also asked Hernandez whether the former star was telling the truth about Lloyd. "He swore on the baby\'s life that he was telling the truth," Briggs said. Hernandez was arrested in connection with Lloyd\'s death a week after that meeting with Kraft. The Patriots released Hernandez less than two hours after the arrest on June 26, 2013. Jenkins, 25, and Hernandez are the parents of a young daughter. Jenkins\' sister Shaneah was dating Lloyd, 27, who was shot six times, according to prosecutors. The trial began in late January.\n\nSummary:', params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=128, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=False, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: [128000, 9370, 5730, 553, 279, 2768, 3754, 4652, 304, 220, 4386, 11460, 13, 5321, 2612, 279, 12399, 1193, 11, 2085, 904, 1023, 1495, 382, 17064, 512, 3100, 9944, 8, 11874, 2919, 1306, 92173, 46296, 574, 1766, 5710, 11, 1561, 9635, 33617, 6917, 26757, 54521, 7111, 1139, 279, 6548, 315, 2128, 6506, 8563, 65660, 323, 1071, 568, 574, 25226, 11, 65660, 39873, 7742, 304, 54521, 596, 10102, 9269, 13, 65660, 11, 36864, 4860, 505, 264, 36151, 323, 832, 315, 54521, 596, 31434, 389, 279, 11550, 2559, 304, 264, 22108, 59220, 11, 32230, 264, 879, 10652, 430, 568, 1047, 449, 279, 6917, 33617, 10508, 842, 389, 5651, 220, 777, 11, 520, 279, 33617, 6, 21456, 10010, 23462, 11, 439, 3754, 9041, 430, 54521, 574, 1694, 27313, 304, 46296, 596, 4648, 13, 330, 1548, 1071, 568, 574, 539, 6532, 1359, 65660, 39873, 304, 279, 59220, 304, 15128, 11188, 13, 330, 1548, 1071, 568, 574, 25226, 1210, 54521, 706, 1027, 11684, 449, 10102, 323, 706, 40001, 539, 16390, 311, 66228, 1113, 279, 4648, 315, 46296, 11, 264, 5347, 49889, 9141, 2851, 889, 574, 1766, 5710, 304, 22108, 389, 5651, 220, 1114, 11, 220, 679, 18, 13, 54521, 1101, 706, 40001, 539, 16390, 311, 264, 6166, 323, 37768, 6900, 13, 5414, 1080, 29899, 29410, 11, 62023, 39956, 323, 30397, 79650, 11, 1101, 40001, 539, 16390, 323, 690, 387, 6818, 26214, 13, 65660, 39873, 430, 568, 4691, 311, 6604, 449, 54521, 304, 459, 5274, 3221, 264, 4785, 3130, 304, 279, 24833, 11, 323, 4691, 279, 2851, 311, 1427, 1461, 304, 279, 8071, 323, 3371, 1461, 422, 568, 574, 6532, 304, 46296, 596, 4648, 13, 10771, 311, 65660, 11, 54521, 3309, 1461, 2391, 430, 6574, 430, 568, 26253, 279, 892, 315, 46296, 596, 4648, 330, 6142, 704, 1359, 1606, 54521, 1047, 1027, 520, 264, 6469, 430, 3814, 13, 10771, 311, 24365, 505, 54521, 596, 76672, 66, 8047, 11, 74984, 12930, 45236, 11, 279, 2851, 1047, 539, 1027, 520, 264, 6469, 11, 719, 574, 520, 14177, 449, 1077, 323, 1063, 4885, 1603, 279, 10658, 13, 11220, 88315, 11, 264, 20352, 5897, 18738, 11, 2663, 65660, 596, 24365, 330, 4683, 2353, 535, 1210, 330, 3923, 264, 2294, 11, 2294, 11550, 369, 279, 32699, 1359, 1364, 1071, 13, 330, 71903, 1148, 7077, 374, 26757, 54521, 47253, 311, 813, 13697, 13, 1628, 279, 1193, 1648, 499, 84129, 433, 374, 422, 499, 2231, 1461, 389, 279, 2559, 1210, 2650, 1550, 54521, 1440, 994, 279, 10102, 7077, 11, 88315, 4691, 11, 7389, 568, 574, 1070, 30, 578, 33617, 6, 6506, 1101, 39873, 11, 994, 4691, 555, 264, 9232, 14065, 11, 430, 568, 4265, 2646, 1047, 904, 5435, 449, 54521, 11, 323, 430, 279, 2851, 574, 2744, 49150, 311, 1461, 13, 578, 47794, 8622, 349, 315, 578, 65660, 5856, 11, 264, 2883, 449, 12034, 24950, 505, 5684, 323, 24066, 10742, 311, 10034, 323, 16924, 11, 1071, 54521, 2744, 44865, 1461, 449, 264, 30884, 323, 21735, 13, 53763, 555, 279, 9232, 3249, 54521, 574, 8667, 311, 264, 400, 1272, 3610, 1317, 9860, 5226, 11, 65660, 1071, 5042, 25, 330, 1548, 596, 264, 1633, 1695, 2851, 1210, 2468, 3115, 2391, 813, 220, 966, 4520, 477, 779, 389, 279, 11550, 2559, 11, 65660, 9508, 29213, 13, 330, 5519, 499, 990, 7673, 45039, 6406, 11182, 18919, 12656, 14583, 64, 1130, 88, 4691, 65660, 13, 330, 40, 1781, 779, 11, 10035, 1210, 53763, 1405, 568, 6575, 11, 65660, 16846, 11, 220, 16, 68031, 11004, 11, 477, 21456, 10010, 23462, 11, 1405, 279, 7445, 20904, 34838, 1514, 872, 2162, 3953, 13, 330, 3923, 656, 499, 656, 369, 990, 7673, 330, 47916, 814, 2610, 757, 311, 656, 1210, 42251, 5590, 11, 23712, 555, 18632, 11, 65660, 13605, 51978, 927, 46296, 596, 4648, 13, 330, 32, 893, 8636, 1359, 568, 1071, 13, 330, 2028, 374, 922, 264, 893, 1694, 7577, 13, 1102, 596, 34707, 1210, 25929, 11, 4488, 94217, 11, 2010, 315, 4868, 520, 21456, 10010, 23462, 11, 39873, 430, 568, 1101, 4691, 54521, 3508, 279, 4846, 6917, 574, 11890, 279, 8206, 922, 46296, 13, 330, 1548, 92307, 389, 279, 8945, 596, 2324, 430, 568, 574, 11890, 279, 8206, 1359, 94217, 1071, 13, 54521, 574, 12800, 304, 3717, 449, 46296, 596, 4648, 264, 2046, 1306, 430, 6574, 449, 65660, 13, 578, 33617, 6004, 54521, 2753, 1109, 1403, 4207, 1306, 279, 8163, 389, 5651, 220, 1627, 11, 220, 679, 18, 13, 45236, 11, 220, 914, 11, 323, 54521, 527, 279, 6699, 315, 264, 3995, 10003, 13, 45236, 6, 13219, 51075, 1494, 574, 5029, 46296, 11, 220, 1544, 11, 889, 574, 6689, 4848, 3115, 11, 4184, 311, 31920, 13, 578, 9269, 6137, 304, 3389, 6186, 382, 19791, 25], prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

Please output the summary only, without any other text.\n\nArticle:\nSimon Danczuk has lambasted the Labour leader Ed Miliband. Ed Miliband is a 'f****** knob' who costs Labour votes, according to one of his own MPs. Outspoken backbencher Simon Danczuk said the Labour leader was seen as more of a 'toff' than David Cameron because he was too 'aloof' from voters' everyday lives. Ordinary people would rather go for a pint with the Prime Minister than the Labour leader - and any MP who said  otherwise was 'telling lies', Mr Danczuk said. He said: 'I spend four hours knocking on doors on a Sunday – they [constituents] say things like 'you're doing an alright job as MP but I don't want Ed Miliband as Prime Minister, so I won't vote for you'.' Mr Danczuk's bombshell remarks come just 45 days before the general election – and less than two weeks before the official campaign kicks off. The Labour backbencher tore into Mr Miliband for failing to connect with voters outside London and lambasted his decision to apologise for posing with a copy of the Sun newspaper. He said the public couldn't understand the Labour leader's decision to pose for a picture holding the Sun – while also claiming he had been right to apologise after the image sparked fury on Merseyside. Mr Danczuk said: 'It's that sort of double speak from politicians: How could he be right on both counts? That turns people off politics. 'So when somebody hears a politician say that, you know what they think, if you pardon the language: 'What a f****** knob'. That's the reality of it.' Mr Danczuk also blasted Labour's deputy leader Harriet Harman for the same 'double speak'. The Labour backbencher said Mr Miliband was harming his chances of re-election. Mr Danczuk only won his seat by 889 votes in 2010, narrowly defeating the Liberal Democrat candidate Paul Rowen. Voters would prefer to go for a pint with the Prime Minister than the Labour leader - pictured in Scotland today - and any MP who said otherwise was 'telling lies', Simon Danczuk said. Mr Miliband  delivered a speech to activists  in Clydebank, Scotland, today as the party's struggles north of the border continue - with the latest polls showing a landslide victory for the SNP in May. Simon Danczuk was only elected in 2010 but has already established himself as one of Parliament's most prominent backbench MPs. The Rochdale MP led the campaign to expose historic child sexual abuse - revealing in shocking detail the crimes of his paedophile predecessor, Cyril Smith. But Mr Danczuk has also launched a series of attacks on his own party - including over immigration, benefits and the lack of working class MPs. He even criticised his own mother for relying on welfare and revealed he had taken drugs. His profile has also been enhanced by his wife Karen, who has risen to fame after posting a series of provocative selfies on Twitter. He said: 'You get it on the doorstep. If we're having a straight conversation about this, he [Miliband] has an image of being more of a toff than David Cameron. That's how the public see it. 'And what they mean by that is that he's seen as more aloof. They'd prefer to go for a pint with David Cameron than they would with Ed Miliband, that's the reality of it.' Mr Danczuk said if the Labour Party knew the cost of electing Mr Miliband in September 2010 they would have chosen another leader. This scathing criticism, in an interview with the New Statesman, comes amid growing concern in the party over Labour's chances in the election in May. But Mr Danczuk said the Labour Party could be in trouble for years to come. He said: 'I do think the party has almost been hijacked by what I've described previously as a north London liberal elite. It's just so disconnected. 'I think Labour has a real problem if they don't realign themselves actually, after the general election. If they don't start thinking afresh about how they approach politics and how they involve people at a community level.' Mr Danczuk added:\xa0'You know, this north London elite view of the world, just doesn't play in Rochdale, Rotherham, Runcorn or anywhere else beginning with an 'r' outside the M25. 'We should be winning Rugby shouldn't we? Why aren't we winning Rugby – we won't win Rugby. Why won't we win Rugby? It's ridiculous. 'So you can't, as leader, just do set piece speeches for three years – hidden behind a lectern – and hope that gets on the 10 o'clock news and convinces loads of people to vote Labour.' The infamous Gillian Duffy (right) - accused by the former prime minister Gordon Brown of being a 'bigoted women' - opens the new office of Labour MP Simon Danczuk (left) in Rochdale in 2010. The Labour MP used Twitter to insist he had had a'very difficult day' and was 'feeling emotional' about the election. Mr Danczuk said voters were also unenthusiastic about the Prime Minister David Cameron and insisted he wanted Ed Miliband to win the election. He said he was trying to get across the need for more working-class politicians in positions of power. Conservative Party Chairman Grant Shapps MP said Mr Danczuk's remarks showed even Labour MPs knew Mr Miliband 'just isn’t up to the job'. He said: ‘He is a weak leader who it utterly out of touch with the lives and concerns of hardworking taxpayers. ‘Not only is Ed Miliband ‘aloof’, his short-term gimmicks would cause chaos and damage the economic security upon which British families depend.’ But Mr Danczuk later tried to clarify his remarks - insisting that he wanted Mr Miliband to be the next Prime Minister. In a series of tweets, the Labour backbencher said he had been 'feeling emotional' after a tough day.\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0,

Please output the summary only, without any other text.\n\nArticle:\nGeorge Osborne declared Britain had reached a ‘massive moment’ after new figures revealed there have never been more people in work. The Chancellor said 73.3 per cent of working-age people were employed – the highest rate since records began in 1971. The Government said the UK had enjoyed the fastest growth in employment of any major economy in the world over the past year. Scroll down for video. Chancellor George Osborne, who has said that 73.3 per cent of working age people are now in employment. The jobless total is 1.86million, the lowest since the summer of 2008 and almost half a million down on a year ago. The unemployment rate is 5.7 per cent, compared to a European Union average of 9.8 per cent. Mr Osborne said 1,000 more people had found employment every day since the Coalition came to power in 2010, with a record 30.94million people now working. The proportion of people claiming Jobseeker’s Allowance has also fallen to its lowest level for 40 years, according to the Office for National Statistics. Addressing MPs yesterday, Mr Osborne boasted: ‘The evidence is plain to see. Britain is working again.’ Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith, who hailed the'remarkable' employment figures. The Chancellor said it had been a ‘truly national recovery’, with more cities in the North and the Midlands feeling the benefits of the UK’s economic growth. He added: ‘Where is employment growing fastest? The North West. Where is a job being created every ten minutes? The Midlands. And which county has created more jobs than the whole of France? The great county of Yorkshire. ‘We are getting the whole of Britain back to work.’ Forecasts published by the independent Office for Budget Responsibility yesterday showed the number of people in employment would rise by another million by 2019. It also predicted the UK’s unemployment rate will fall from the current 5.3 per cent to 5.2 per cent next year, returning to 5.3 per cent until 2019. Meanwhile, the ONS revealed that annual growth in private sector employment was five times the size of the fall in the public sector. This challenges claims by Labour that the private sector would not be able to compensate for the number of people made redundant by the State as a result of spending cuts. Public sector employment fell by 140,000 last year to 5.4million, the lowest level since records began in 1999 and a fall of almost a million since its peak in late 2009. But employment in the private sector hit a record high of 25.5million, after rising by 757,000 in just one year. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said: ‘This is a remarkable set of figures, which underlines this Government’s success in backing businesses to create jobs, and supporting British people to seize those opportunities. ‘As a country we should be proud that there are now record numbers of people in work, record numbers of job vacancies available, and the lowest unemployment rate since 2008. ‘For every single day that this Government has been in power we have seen an average of 1,000 more people in work.’ Prime Minister David Cameron said: ‘The highest employment rate in our history is not a dry fact. ‘It means more people with the security of a pay packet and a brighter future.’ Nick Clegg may have praised the Liberal Democrats’ contribution to the Budget – but last night his party was preparing its own rival offering, writes Tamara Cohen. In a highly unusual move, Treasury chief Danny Alexander will today address the House of Commons to outline Lib Dem economic plans. He will even have his own yellow Budget Box, which will later be handed over to a party donor who paid £1,500 for it at an auction during the spring conference last weekend. Lib Dem leader and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, takes in yesterday's budget in the House of Commons. Treasury chief Danny Alexander will today address the House of Commons to outline Lib Dem economic plans. After skipping last year’s Autumn Statement, Mr Clegg made sure he was on the front bench to hear the good news in the Budget yesterday, but was spotted fiddling with his phone and pulling a series of faces. He has insisted it was a ‘Coalition Budget’. But the Chief Secretary to the Treasury will say today that while his party supports the plans for this year, after 2016 it would diverge from them dramatically. In a speech some Labour and Tory MPs are likely to see as a misuse of Government time, Mr Alexander will propose more borrowing for infrastructure. He is expected to accuse the Tories of making ‘cuts for cuts’ sake’ – and Labour of planning a spending spree if they win office. The Lib Dems want to increase the personal tax allowance to £12,500, add more council tax bands for expensive homes, and raise capital gains tax for the wealthiest. A senior Lib Dem said: ‘Our spending plans post 2015-16 differ from the Tories in a number of key areas. We agree on the need to balance the current budget by 2017-18, but they are talking about running a surplus by carrying on cutting after that.’\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1,

Aftermath: \xa0Li Tan went to the shop and bought 30 sanitary towels before sticking them to her boyfriend's car in front of stunned passers-by. Scorned: Angry Li Tan, 23, from China, decided to stick sanitary pads to her boyfriend's car because she thought he was cheating on her. When De failed to return home an hour after he'd promised, his furious girlfriend went to a nearby shop, bought 30 sanitary towels and stuck them on his rental car as stunned passers-by watched on. Li's friend, Chung Chen, 24, said: 'She was furious, and I told her she should wait to see what he said before she attacked the car, as it wasn't even his.' 'But she wouldn't listen as she was convinced he was cheating on her and so I let her get on with it. It made her feel better,' she added. Li then posted pictures of the Toyota online with the caption: 'That's right, I did it!!' She was soon swamped with messages of support from online viewers.\xa0Xia Lo posted: 'Great move! That'll teach him.' Tao Fang added: 'Hahaha, go for it, girl.' And Yu Feng wrote: 'You should have done it with used ones.'

Please output the summary only, without any other text.\n\nArticle:\nArsenal manager Arsene Wenger is hopeful Francis Coquelin and Aaron Ramsey will ease his midfield selection problems for Wednesday's clash against Queens Park Rangers. Coquelin, who has been a revelation for the Gunners since his return from a loan spell at Charlton, fractured his nose in Sunday's win over Everton and is a doubt for the visit to Loftus Road. Wenger feared the Frenchman may require surgery, but it is understood Coquelin has not been ruled out of the clash against Rangers and could still play in the London derby despite taking the hefty blow. Aaron Ramsey has suffered from fitness problems this season but could return against Queens Park Rangers. The Welsh midfielder has not played for the Gunners since their clash against Leicester in early February. Gunners medical staff will make a late call on his availability and if Coquelin is selected, he'll be fitted for a protective mask to ensure no further damage is caused. In addition, key midfielder Ramsey is set for a first team recall after recovering from a hamstring injury. The Wales international hasn't played since February 10, limping off during the closing stages of Arsenal's 2-1 win over Leicester. But Ramsey returned to training towards the end of last week and should be available for selection on Wednesday night. His return to fitness means Arsenal could yet decide against risking Coquelin's nose against Chris Ramsey's side despite his growing importance to the first-team. This clash of heads in the left Francis Coquelin with bloody gushing out of his nose against Everton. Midfielder Coquelin had to be substituted after fracturing his nose but could also return against QPR.\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=128, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=False, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: [128000, 9370, 5730, 553, 279, 2768, 3754, 4652, 304, 220, 4386, 11460, 13, 5321, 2612, 279, 12399, 1193, 11, 2085, 904, 1023, 1495, 382, 17064, 512, 84073, 75497, 6783, 73938, 1994, 78027, 374, 38650, 26184, 3623, 447, 33830, 323, 26757, 65646, 690, 14553, 813, 30789, 6727, 5435, 369, 8079, 596, 41003, 2403, 28162, 5657, 34287, 13, 3623, 447, 33830, 11, 889, 706, 1027, 264, 40010, 369, 279, 22450, 5079, 2533, 813, 471, 505, 264, 11941, 13141, 520, 46466, 783, 11, 80208, 813, 19689, 304, 7418, 596, 3243, 927, 63539, 323, 374, 264, 10712, 369, 279, 4034, 311, 84254, 355, 9728, 13, 78027, 38569, 279, 8753, 1543, 1253, 1397, 15173, 11, 719, 433, 374, 16365, 3623, 447, 33830, 706, 539, 1027, 21989, 704, 315, 279, 41003, 2403, 34287, 323, 1436, 2103, 1514, 304, 279, 7295, 91770, 8994, 4737, 279, 65242, 12523, 13, 26757, 65646, 706, 16654, 505, 17479, 5435, 420, 3280, 719, 1436, 471, 2403, 28162, 5657, 34287, 13, 578, 46881, 45067, 706, 539, 6476, 369, 279, 22450, 5079, 2533, 872, 41003, 2403, 58849, 304, 4216, 7552, 13, 22450, 5079, 6593, 5687, 690, 1304, 264, 3389, 1650, 389, 813, 18539, 323, 422, 3623, 447, 33830, 374, 4183, 11, 568, 3358, 387, 29441, 369, 264, 29219, 7056, 311, 6106, 912, 4726, 5674, 374, 9057, 13, 763, 5369, 11, 1401, 45067, 65646, 374, 743, 369, 264, 1176, 2128, 19635, 1306, 42386, 505, 264, 90805, 11134, 13, 578, 23782, 6625, 12775, 956, 6476, 2533, 7552, 220, 605, 11, 4671, 10194, 1022, 2391, 279, 15676, 18094, 315, 33102, 596, 220, 17, 12, 16, 3243, 927, 58849, 13, 2030, 65646, 6052, 311, 4967, 7119, 279, 842, 315, 1566, 2046, 323, 1288, 387, 2561, 369, 6727, 389, 8079, 3814, 13, 5414, 471, 311, 17479, 3445, 33102, 1436, 3686, 10491, 2403, 86022, 3623, 447, 33830, 596, 19689, 2403, 11517, 65646, 596, 3185, 8994, 813, 7982, 12939, 311, 279, 1176, 43942, 13, 1115, 41003, 315, 14971, 304, 279, 2163, 26184, 3623, 447, 33830, 449, 36277, 342, 41913, 704, 315, 813, 19689, 2403, 63539, 13, 14013, 2630, 261, 3623, 447, 33830, 1047, 311, 387, 63196, 1306, 27700, 1711, 813, 19689, 719, 1436, 1101, 471, 2403, 1229, 6616, 382, 19791, 25], prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

David Summers, 70, and his wife Maria, 66, have been happily married since 1970, and have a 42-year-old son, Derick, who holds a British passport. The couple lived in Ontario, Canada, until September 2013, when they moved back to the UK to care for Mr Summers's sick mother. But border officials have now refused retired optician Mrs Summers's application for a permanent UK visa because they don't believe the pensioners have a real 'affectionate relationship'. Border officials have questioned David and Maria Summers' relationship and denied her a visa - despite them having been happily married for 45 years. Pictured, right: The couple on their wedding day in 1970. The decision was appealed and it is currently being considered by the UK Border Agency, who have told the couple that no final ruling will be made until the end of May. The couple, who own a house in Hereford, are meanwhile desperately trying to prove  that their marriage is genuine for fear Mrs Summers could be permanently excluded from the UK when her temporary tourist visa expires. Mrs Summers said: 'It's ridiculous, we are quite willing to give the border people what they want but they are adamant. I don't know what they want us to prove. 'Anyone who has ever spoken to us can clearly see that we are best friends and have been since the day we met. 'We've got almost half a century's worth of birthday cards, 45 years of holiday snaps from all ove the world. 'We've got pictures of us with our son just after he was born, growing up, right up to his wedding day. If they'd asked us to send us all of those photos, we could have done.' Mr Summers, a retired retailer and published author, added: 'Why pick on us? We've been married for 45 years and we are completely devoted to one another, what do they want us to do? 'We could show them pictures, e-mails, texts, everything from our marriage, but they have not asked us for anything. They are doing this based on no evidence at all.' The couple say they have five decades' worth of pictures to prove their long-running marriage is genuine - but were not asked to provide any evidence when applying for the visa. Mr Summers said: 'We love each other very much, it's  hurtful for them to suggest our marriage is not real' Mr Summers added: 'They haven't even given us a chance to prove that our marriage is real. We've got a marriage certificate and a son, what more do they want? 'We love each other very much, it's really hurtful for them to suggest that our marriage is not real.' Mrs Summers's application for a permanent UK visa was rejected by British authorities, with a letter citing the reason for rejection stating: 'You have not provided any evidence that your relationship is still subsisting. 'It is reasonable to expect that in a genuine subsisting, supportive and affectionate relationship, there would be evidence of regular contact, signs of companionship, emotional support, affection, and abiding interest in each other's welfare and well-being throughout the entire duration of your relationship....I am therefore not satisfied that your relationship is not genuine.' The pair met at a dance in Kingston, Ontario in 1966 while Mr Summers was in the country working in retail and soon fell in love. Mr and Mrs Summers lived in Canada after they married in 1970. They want to move to the house they own in Hereford so they can look after Mr Summers's mother. They say the decision has been made all the more extraordinary by the fact that they have grown-up son. They married in 1970 and lived in Kingston until 1981, when they moved to Ottawa. The couple made frequent visits back to the UK and bought their house in Hereford in 1995 for Mr Summers's elderly mother Doris Murray to live in. They made the trip back in September 2013 and intended to retire in Hereford and care for Doris, who had fallen ill. David said: 'We filled in a load of forms when we had Derick which meant we could come back and forth as much as we wanted, but for us to retire here permanently, we found out Maria needed to have this pemanent visa. 'If Maria's second visa application fails, we would have no choice but to move back to Canada. 'We would have to sell our home and move my mother into a care home. We have family here but they cannot look after her. 'I find it utterly extraordinary, I can't really contemplate life without my wife.' The Home Office, which runs the UK Border Agency, has yet to comment on the case. Mrs Summers now has to wait until May for her appeal to be finalised, but she fears she and her husband may have to move back to Canada if she is not allowed to stay.\n\nSummary:", params:

Green Farm, near to the village of Ashton in Northhamptonshire, also features a seven-bedroom farmhouse and it is the first time the property has been on the market for 150 years. Andrew Meikle, from estate agents Bletsoes, said this is a chance for people to own a picturesque piece of England 'as beautiful as anything in the Cotswolds', but for a fraction of the price. Sprawling: Green Farm estate features this seven bedroom Grade II listed farmhouse which is set in 600 acres of grounds and farmland. Hertiage: The estate has been passed down through the generations of the Rothschild family, and this is believed to be the first time it has come up for sale in 150 years. Bargain: For £8million the buyer will also get this three-acre wooded island situated in the River Nene which is accessible by weir (left) The estate was initially owned by the Rothschild family and is currently occupied by their descendants, having been passed down through generations. During the 19th century, when the family were believed to hold the largest private fortune in the world, they helped to remodel the village of Ashton for the workers they employed on the estate. The Grade II listed farmhouse is in a secluded location on the edge of the picturesque village. There are also two listed thatched cottages on the land - the three-bedroom West Lodge and one-bedroom Shepherdess Cottage. The farmland is spread out between Polebrook, Ashton and Oundle with 500 acres of arable land for growing crops, 70 acres of pasture land for keeping livestock and almost 60 acres of woodland. The buyer would also get their own private island - three acres of woodland in the middle of the River Nene, which you can access by a weir. Mr Meikle said: 'As far as we know this is the first time the property has come on the open market in 150 years. It's a Rothschild property, it belongs to descendants of the family and has been handed down for generations. Huge: A satellite image showing the entire 600 acre estate. Number 1 shows the position of the main house, number 2 is the location of Shepherdess Cottage, number three marks West Lodge, and number 4 is the island in the River Nene. Inset top left and bottom right are two plots of land that are also included. Top right in the position of all three portions of the estate to scale. Beautiful: The price tag includes two listed cottages located within the grounds, including this three-bedroom property named West Lodge. Quaint: Tucked away in another corner of the huge estate is this one-bedroom thatched property named\xa0Shepherdess Cottage. Vast: Among the 600 acres that come with the houses are 500 acres of arable land for growing crops, 70 acres of pasture land for keeping livestock and almost 60 acres of woodland. 'We're very open-minded about how it might sell. There are a number of properties, lots of land and it's even got an island. It's the perfect opportunity for someone to buy a bit of England. 'It's in Northamptonshire, a really picturesque, forgotten part of the country - it's as nice as places in the Cotswolds but for quarter the price. 'A local farmer who came to look at it said he can't remember anything of this size being available in the last 20 years. 'It's got some great commercial land, a lovely frontage on the river, meadows, woodlands and development potential. There's pasture land that could be used for traditional livestock, or might appeal to the equine market as well. It's got absolutely loads of potential. 'The island is three acres of mature woodland and sits in the middle of the River Nene. You cross to the island by weir. 'Viewings have been getting booked up already and we've even got potential investors coming from abroad.'\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0,

Please output the summary only, without any other text.\n\nArticle:\nIt was first hollowed out by in the 1990s the Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E), which had been buying up local properties for decades, only for many more residents to flee after the organization was proven to have contaminated groundwater with hexavalent chromium. Now the town of Hinkley, California - a Mojave Desert community famous for being'saved' by Erin Brockovich and then immortalized in Steven Soderberg's Oscar-winning film  - has been all-but deserted. After the movie was released in 2000, PG&E - who paid out $333 million in an out-of-court settlement - never halted its crusade to obtain land rights for most of the town, and last year stopped delivering bottled water to the few locals that remained, after tests in the area showed the chromium levels were below the maximum. As a result, Hinkley has sadly started to grind to a halt. Closed for business: Hinkley, the The Mojave Desert community whose toxic chromium contamination was portrayed in the movie 'Erin Brockovich', has already lost its post office and will now lose its only gas station and convenience store. Shutting down: Hinkley's business has been dwindling as the community struggled with concerns over the cancer-causing chromium-6 in well water. Here, Ali Abu Hantash, owner of Hinkley Market & Gas, sits and waits for customers to enter his general store in Hinkley, Calif. The store will close in the coming weeks. Deserted:\xa0Hinkley, an unincorporated community in the Mojave Desert, in San Bernardino County, California, 14 miles northwest of Barstow, suffered greatly from its only school shutting down. According to Vice, PG&E \xa0continued their buy out to reduce the risk of any more lawsuits. In March this year, the Hinkley post office closed. Postal officials say they will be looking for a new location for the Hinkley Post Office, which had been at the same location since 1958. The number of street deliveries in Hinkley has dropped by nearly 38 percent — from 504 in 2012 to 321 in 2015, U.S. Postal Service spokeswoman Eva M. Jackson told the San Bernardino Sun newspaper. Huge hit: Erin Brockovich, starring Julia Roberts, was released on March 17, 2000, and grossed $28.1 million on its opening weekend. It went on to make $126.6 million in North America and $130.7 million worldwide. Rented boxes dropped 76 percent, from 321 to 75, during the same period, she said. During the 1950s and 1960s, PG&E used chromium-6 to kill algae and protect the metal at its Hinkley natural gas pumping station. Decades later, residents blamed their illnesses on a plume of contaminated groundwater that is 8 miles long and 2 miles wide. The utility reached a $333 million settlement with residents in a case portrayed in the hit 2000 film 'Erin Brockovich,' starring Julia Roberts. Iconic: Albert Finney and Julia Roberts walk down the main street of Hinkley in a scene from Erin Brockovich. Business at the convenience store — the Hinkley Market — collapsed after the nearby Hinkley Elementary School closed in June 2013, the newspaper said. The school shut down because of dwindling enrollment. The market and gas station - the only store and place to get gas - will close at the end of April. The store was bought out by PG&E. 'It's another blow to the community,' Lester White, a longtime community advocate, said of the loss of the town's only storefront. No Hollywood ending: Hinkley has been decimated by the toxic water that has infected the area the decades. Empty: PG&E have been buying up homes in Hinkley for years just to knock them down and leave the land. Ruins: Some of the homes have been left sitting, rotting away. Locals say the town is nothing like what it used to be, but a few farms still remain. The land parcel containing the gas station, market and post office is owned by Barstow resident Tawfig A. Musitef, who could not be reached for comment. According to Brenda McIlvain, owner of Riley's Place, a roadside dive bar, the town was once 'full of such nice people'. 'But I don't think Hinkley will ever be like it used to be,' she told Vice. PG&E spokesman Jeff Smith told the Sun that the company is in negotiations to buy the parcel. PG&E has been buying residential properties in Hinkley for decades as people seek to relocate.\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0,

Please output the summary only, without any other text.\n\nArticle:\nTerrifying new reports have revealed that farmers in New Zealand have been sent letters which threaten to contaminate baby formula, in an apparent protest against the use of pesticides. Sent anonymously to Federation Farmers and Fonterra in November, the letters also included small packages of milk powder which were laced with concentrated 1080 poison, according to the\xa0NZ Herald. Detailed in the letters were threats claiming that if New Zealand didn't stop using poison 1080 - a chemical used in pesticides - by the end of March the senders would contaminate baby and other formulas. Letters sent to Federation Farmers in New Zealand last November contained threats to contaminate baby formula with poison 1080. Police are now appealing for the public's help in catching the letter senders. They launched their investigation in November, headed up by an Auckland-based team called Operation Concord and involving up to 36 police officers. New Zealand's Prime Minister John Key has described the attack as a 'form of ecoterrorism'. 'Police have advised there is a low likelihood of the threat being carried out, but because of the nature of it, both the police and ministers have taken the treat seriously,' Mr Key said in a press conference in Parliament according to the NZ Herald. He also added that testing through each step of the supply chain was carried out before the public was notified of the potential threat. Mike Clement, Police Deputy Commissioner of National Operations said the threat needed to be treated in a serious matter despite that fact it could be a hoax. Mr Clement urged the person, or people, responsible for the distribution of the letters to make themselves known to police. 'The letter writer may not have really considered the implications of their actions when this communication was drafted,' Mr Clement said. No specific brand was targeted and officials say they are certain no formulas are currently contaminated. Ministry for Primary Industries Deputy Director General Scott Gallagher said he was sure that New Zealand baby and other formula was still safe despite the threats. 'This criminal threat is designed to cause fear in order to generate a domestic policy outcome,' Mr Gallagher also said. He also confirmed that there is currently no 1080 poison in any baby formula. Mr Clement urged people to check packets for any signs of tampering or interference after 'this criminal blackmail threat', and said that no particular brand had been targeted. As officials have been aware of the threat since last November, they are positive that there is currently no danger of contamination and in fact formulas are safer than ever due to stricter screening and control. Global dairy company Fonterra said the whole industry is onside with the investigation, ready to assist police and government officials. Chief executive Theo Spierings revealed the news of the threat made him 'quite angry.'\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=128, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=False, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: [128000, 9370, 5730, 553, 279, 2768, 3754, 4652, 304, 220, 4386, 11460, 13, 5321, 2612, 279, 12399, 1193, 11, 2085, 904, 1023, 1495, 382, 17064, 512, 52502, 7922, 502, 6821, 617, 10675, 430, 20957, 304, 1561, 17340, 617, 1027, 3288, 12197, 902, 40250, 311, 687, 309, 3357, 8945, 15150, 11, 304, 459, 10186, 8835, 2403, 279, 1005, 315, 61257, 13, 24248, 73251, 311, 28331, 63422, 323, 71593, 48921, 304, 6841, 11, 279, 12197, 1101, 5343, 2678, 14519, 315, 14403, 17138, 902, 1051, 326, 4535, 449, 38626, 220, 6640, 15, 21109, 11, 4184, 311, 279, 4194, 71030, 42769, 13, 63765, 304, 279, 12197, 1051, 18208, 21039, 430, 422, 1561, 17340, 3287, 956, 3009, 1701, 21109, 220, 6640, 15, 482, 264, 11742, 1511, 304, 61257, 482, 555, 279, 842, 315, 5587, 279, 3708, 388, 1053, 687, 309, 3357, 8945, 323, 1023, 55179, 13, 45397, 3288, 311, 28331, 63422, 304, 1561, 17340, 1566, 6841, 13282, 18208, 311, 687, 309, 3357, 8945, 15150, 449, 21109, 220, 6640, 15, 13, 10289, 527, 1457, 33352, 369, 279, 586, 596, 1520, 304, 34168, 279, 6661, 3708, 388, 13, 2435, 11887, 872, 8990, 304, 6841, 11, 19946, 709, 555, 459, 54346, 6108, 2128, 2663, 17145, 64193, 323, 16239, 709, 311, 220, 1927, 4379, 9808, 13, 1561, 17340, 596, 12801, 9675, 3842, 5422, 706, 7633, 279, 3440, 439, 264, 364, 630, 315, 12208, 354, 850, 2191, 4527, 364, 22993, 617, 26160, 1070, 374, 264, 3428, 29736, 315, 279, 6023, 1694, 11953, 704, 11, 719, 1606, 315, 279, 7138, 315, 433, 11, 2225, 279, 4379, 323, 35050, 617, 4529, 279, 4322, 14243, 2965, 4491, 5422, 1071, 304, 264, 3577, 10017, 304, 20302, 4184, 311, 279, 42857, 42769, 13, 1283, 1101, 3779, 430, 7649, 1555, 1855, 3094, 315, 279, 8312, 8957, 574, 11953, 704, 1603, 279, 586, 574, 30316, 315, 279, 4754, 6023, 13, 11519, 53227, 11, 10289, 32724, 30454, 315, 5165, 25927, 1071, 279, 6023, 4460, 311, 387, 12020, 304, 264, 6129, 5030, 8994, 430, 2144, 433, 1436, 387, 264, 73944, 13, 4491, 53227, 28932, 279, 1732, 11, 477, 1274, 11, 8647, 369, 279, 8141, 315, 279, 12197, 311, 1304, 5694, 3967, 311, 4379, 13, 364, 791, 6661, 7061, 1253, 539, 617, 2216, 6646, 279, 25127, 315, 872, 6299, 994, 420, 10758, 574, 39056, 2965, 4491, 53227, 1071, 13, 2360, 3230, 6883, 574, 17550, 323, 7510, 2019, 814, 527, 3738, 912, 55179, 527, 5131, 52673, 13, 20214, 369, 26150, 37528, 32724, 10783, 3331, 10016, 79087, 1071, 568, 574, 2771, 430, 1561, 17340, 8945, 323, 1023, 15150, 574, 2103, 6220, 8994, 279, 18208, 13, 364, 2028, 9337, 6023, 374, 6319, 311, 5353, 8850, 304, 2015, 311, 7068, 264, 13018, 4947, 15632, 2965, 4491, 79087, 1101, 1071, 13, 1283, 1101, 11007, 430, 1070, 374, 5131, 912, 220, 6640, 15, 21109, 304, 904, 8945, 15150, 13, 4491, 53227, 28932, 1274, 311, 1817, 28133, 369, 904, 12195, 315, 26555, 61818, 477, 32317, 1306, 364, 576, 9337, 88263, 6023, 518, 323, 1071, 430, 912, 4040, 6883, 1047, 1027, 17550, 13, 1666, 7510, 617, 1027, 8010, 315, 279, 6023, 2533, 1566, 6841, 11, 814, 527, 6928, 430, 1070, 374, 5131, 912, 8137, 315, 47810, 323, 304, 2144, 55179, 527, 30549, 1109, 3596, 4245, 311, 84818, 23061, 323, 2585, 13, 8121, 34479, 2883, 71593, 48921, 1071, 279, 4459, 5064, 374, 389, 3002, 449, 279, 8990, 11, 5644, 311, 7945, 4379, 323, 3109, 7510, 13, 14681, 11145, 85237, 3165, 1291, 826, 10675, 279, 3754, 315, 279, 6023, 1903, 1461, 364, 84270, 19021, 22438, 19791, 25], prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

Please output the summary only, without any other text.\n\nArticle:\nOne is a multimillionaire glamour model with a talent for controversy and a penchant for of plastic surgery. The other is the Duchess of Cornwall. Yet despite their very different lives, Camilla and Katie appeared to get along famously when they bumped into each other on day two of the Cheltenham Festival. Ms Price, who is an equine enthusiast herself, looked very much at ease during her brush with royalty and wore an unusually toned-down ensemble of white jeans and a neat navy jacket. Scroll down for video. Striking a pose: The Duchess of Cornwall happily posed for a photo with Katie Price and a gaggle of fellow racegoers. Unlikely trio: Camilla with Katie Price and her daughter Laura Lopes (centre) Camilla, meanwhile, was on cheerful form and looked wonderful in a Scottish Balmoral tweed suit by couturier Roy Allan and a matching hat by milliner Lock. The Duchess had been making her way back from the paddock, where she presented jockey Sam Twiston-Davies with his trophy after he won the Betway Queen Mother Champion Chase on Dodging Bullets, when she bumped into Ms Price and her friends. When asked by  for a picture, the Duchess was all smiles and gamely obliged, with daughter Laura Lopes also getting into the frame. Camilla's foray into the paddock also resulted in a second celebrity encounter, when the Duchess found herself enjoying a chat with Gloucestershire local, Jilly Cooper. Ms Cooper, who is famous for novels documenting country life, is no stranger to the world of racing having made it the subject of her most recent book, Jump! Another of her equine-themed page turners, horse box-trembling bonkbuster Riders, celebrated its 30th birthday this week and remains one of the UK's favourite novels. Camilla and her two children, Laura, left, and Tom, right, appear overjoyed as they catch one of the races. Lots in common: Jilly Cooper based caddish character Rupert Campbell-Black on Camilla's former husband. Happy couple: Glamour model Katie Price was joined at the races by her plasterer husband Kieran Hayler. Looking good: Katie looked very elegant in a dark blue blazer, which she offset with minimal diamond jewellery. Enjoying their day: Katie Price and her husband Kieran take a walk through the parade ring at Cheltenham. Inspecting the runners: Camilla in the paddock with Tom Parker-Bowles and Robert Waley-Cohen. Winning ways: Jockey Sam Twiston-Davies was handed his trophy by the Duchess of Cornwall. Tense: A tense Duchess of Cornwall roars on the runners as she watches the Novices Hurdle. Victory! Tom Parker-Bowles cheers on his horse, while his mother concedes defeat. The trio went through a range of emotions as they watched the race finish. Celebrating: Mr Parker-Bowles looked ecstatic following his win in the first race of the day. Sibling rivalry: Mr Parker-Bowles mischievously taunts his sister Laura Lopes following his win. Indeed, the Duchess is no stranger to Cooper's oeuvre, with the author once admitting that showjumping cad Rupert Campbell-Black is partially based on Camilla's ex-husband, Andrew Parker-Bowles. Until her star-studded encounters in the paddock, Camilla had been enjoying a family day out in the royal box with her two children, Tom and Laura, and their spouses Harry Lopes and Sara Parker-Bowles. Also at the races was Zara Tindall who returned to the racecourse for a second day and looked lovely in black and white coat and matching black cocktail hat by milliner Rosie Olivia. The Parker-Bowles quartet had arrived at the racecourse together and happily posed for photos before Mail On Sunday food critic Tom got to work sampling the stout sold at a nearby stall. Camilla, meanwhile, had arrived alone and was at the racecourse with work to do, having been asked to present the prize to the winner of the Betway Queen Mother Champion Chase - Mr Twiston-Davies and Dodging Bullets. Still celebrating: Mr Parker-Bowles was still going even after his relations conceded defeat. Watching the action: Laura Lopes and the Duchess of Cornwall react as they watch the first race. Round of applause: The group applaud as Windsor Park gallops home to win the first race. Sharing a joke: The family appeared to be enjoying their day out at the races. The Duchess also did the honours last year and was asked to return by Cheltenham chairman, Robert Waley-Cohen.\xa0'I am delighted that The Duchess of Cornwall will again be attending this year's Festival on Ladies Day,' he said. 'The scenes in the Winner's Enclosure after Sire De Grugy won the Betway Queen Mother Champion Chase were some of the best of the week and this year's race is shaping up to be as competitive as ever.' Camilla, who has long loved horses, was also there to promote her six equestrian charities, among them The British Equestrian Federation, The Brooke Hospital for Animals and Ebony Horse Club. Like her mother-in-law, the Queen, the Duchess is also a racing enthusiast and is a regular visitor to Royal Ascot as well as other race meetings. Looking good: The Duchess cut a glamorous figure in her Roy Allan tweed suit and matching hat. Enjoying their day: L-R Sara Parker-Bowles, Harry Lopes, Laura Lopes and Tom Parker-Bowles. Drink up! Mr Parker-Bowles and brother-in-law Harry Lopes got stuck into a couple of pints on the way in. Stylish: Laura Lopes and Sara Parker-Bowles showed off their ensembles for photographers as they arrived. Enjoying the sunshine: Mr Parker-Bowles indulges in a sunny morning pint. Close: Mr Parker-Bowles and brother-in-law Mr Lopes share a joke over their pints. The Duchess has been having a busy week, which began with a trip to Westminster Abbey for the Commonwealth Day Observance service with Prince Charles. Yesterday, she helped to launch the Big Lunch 2015 campaign with a reception at her London home, Clarence House. The campaign, which is run by the Eden Project, aims to encourage people to 'do lunch' and get to know their neighbours. During the reception, Camilla was introduced to campaign workers and, much to her delight, was presented with a bunch of Welsh daffodils and a gift of Welsh cakes by 11-year-old Marcus Aitken. All smiles: Zara looked delighted to be back at Cheltenham for the second day in a row. Nice hat! Zara opted for a chic black cocktail hat by milliner Rosie Olivia, who also made yesterday's titfer. Looking good: Zara Tindall was also at Cheltenham and enjoyed a second day of racing action. Stylish: Zara topped her check cocoon coat with a neat black cocktail hat - perfect for Ladies Day. Enjoying herself: Zara spent the afternoon chatting happily to friends while watching the races. But while all eyes might have been on the unlikely pairing of Camilla and Katie Price, the royals weren't the only ones to look glamorous on Ladies Day at Cheltenham. With a £15,000 prize to win, scores of women turned up in their finest frocks for the event, with many topping off their look with some out-of-this world millinery. Everything from huge floppy fedoras to glamorous little cocktail numbers adorned the tops of perfectly-coiffed heads, while shoes ranged from sky-high platforms to comfortable country boots. Not everyone opted for brights, however, with several ladies also following Camilla's example and opting for cosy tweed ensembles topped with brushed fur cossack hats. Many racegoers  opted for bold hats in an array of bright colours. This lady shone in an array of autumnal colours. A lady combines a powder pink tweed suit with a fabulous hat featuring a huge spray of pink and black pheasant feathers. Glamorous: Racegoers pulled out all the stops in a bid to impress the judges on Ladies Day. A lady arrives wearing a summery blue floral ensemble while another (right) opted for a daring pink and orange combination. Bold: One lady opted to wear a leopard print top hat, while another opted for a glamorous bright pink trilby. A lady opts for an arty paint-print dress. Winning: Hot favourite Don Poli surged home to win in the RSA Chase. Past the post: Windsor Park ridden by Davy Russell gallops home to win the Novices Hurdle. Whatever they wore, the crowds certainly appeared to enjoy their day and as the racing drew to a close, they headed towards the bars for a warming drink before they headed home. Hundreds of guests made their way to the Moët & Chandon tent, to stock up on mini bottles of champagne, with many making the most of specially-designed plastic funnels. Introduced by the champagne brand to make sipping from the bottle less hazardous to clothes, the funnels also dispensed with the need for plastic glasses, leaving the racecourse staff with less work to do once the crowds departed. Some, however, couldn't resist doing things the traditional way and nipped back to the car park to plunder the supermarket-bought bottles of prosecco that they had been storing in the boot. After the racing ended, women headed in their droves to the Moët & Chandon champagne bar. One lady celebrated with several bottles of champagne. A lady takes a swig from the bottle as she heads back to the car park.\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0,

Please output the summary only, without any other text.\n\nArticle:\nA photo of a giant cat coming down the stairs of a house, teeth bared and biting for the chandelier has caused a sensation on social media. Users have nicknamed the creature Catzilla, Kat Kong and Fluffy Destroyer of Worlds. Others have suggested it would make a great horror movie. Disappointingly, or doubtless to some people's relief, the photo actually shows a normal-sized kitten playfully exploring the inside of a meticulously detailed dollhouse. Hear me roar! The photo of a giant cat destroying a house is actually a kitten playing in a dollhouse. The photo was taken by Cade Ritter, 18, of Austin, Texas, in an effort to get fostered kittens adopted into permanent homes. Ritter, a photography student at Rice University in Houston, took a series of photos at home a few years ago when his family fostered a litter of five kittens with the help of Austin Pets Alive, he told ABC. 'As people started adopting them, my mom thought it would be a good advertisement for the remaining kittens to have a little photo-shoot.' The kitten in the picture was the wildest out of the litter, but was eventually adopted. Ritter kept one of the cats, whom he named Sophie. The photo came about when Ritter and his mom, Austin-based artist Barbara Atwell, decided to use a dollhouse Ritter's great-grandfather had built by hand many years before. 'It's quite the amazing piece of carpentry,' Ritter said. 'It even has a working light system.' Users on Reddit were as impressed by the dollhouse as they were amused by the photo. The general consensus was that  the combination is a winning one. 'I just realized that as a cat owner, I now have a valid reason to buy a dollhouse,' said one user. The photos were taken by Cade Ritter of Austin, Texas, a few years ago to help find foster homes for a litter of five kittens.

While BT, Sky and TalkTalk all scored less than 50 per cent in the Which? poll, John Lewis Broadband, Zen Internet, Utility Warehouse and Plusnet achieved more than 70 per cent. John Lewis came top with 76 per cent while BT was bottom with 45 per cent, just below Sky and TalkTalk, both on 48. Smaller broadband providers have beaten bigger rivals in an annual customer satisfaction survey, with John Lewis (file picture) given the highest score. However, most of the 11 providers in the poll received only three stars for speed, with TalkTalk getting two and only Virgin Media and Zen Internet scoring four. Which? surveyed 1,757 broadband users in December and January. The consumer group wants advertising watchdogs to tighten rules to ensure advertised broadband speeds more closely match most customers' experience. Currently providers can advertise speeds that only 10 per cent of customers actually receive. Campaigners are calling for advertising speed claims such as'superfast' to be quantified by providers, customers to be given written speed estimates at the start of the contract with an accurate estimate for their individual address and users to be allowed to exit contracts without penalty if they do not get the minimum speed estimated at any point in their contract. Which? wants advertising watchdogs to tighten rules to ensure advertised broadband speeds more closely match what is actually provided to customers (picture posed by model) Which? executive director Richard Lloyd said: 'Smaller suppliers are leaving larger rivals in their wake when it comes to the service they provide so we need to see the big players up their game. 'Ofcom is also currently reviewing this market and we now need it to identify how it plans to ensure broadband customers get a better deal. 'We've told the advertising watchdogs that companies need to be much clearer with their customers about the speeds they can expect. However, three months on, we're still waiting for them to announce how they'll ensure adverts only show the speeds most customers actually receive.'\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=128, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=False, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: [128000, 9370, 5730, 553, 279, 2768, 3754, 4652, 304, 220, 4386, 11460, 13, 5321, 2612, 279, 12399, 1193, 11, 2085, 904, 1023, 1495, 382, 17064, 512, 10902, 14283, 41925, 12850, 617, 31394, 11493, 35938, 304, 459, 9974, 6130, 24617, 10795, 13, 6104, 21795, 11, 15064, 323, 19513, 37310, 682, 16957, 2753, 1109, 220, 1135, 824, 2960, 304, 279, 16299, 30, 7230, 11, 3842, 21256, 16273, 7198, 11, 32889, 8191, 11, 26230, 52466, 323, 12623, 4816, 17427, 810, 1109, 220, 2031, 824, 2960, 13, 3842, 21256, 3782, 1948, 449, 220, 4767, 824, 2960, 1418, 21795, 574, 5740, 449, 220, 1774, 824, 2960, 11, 1120, 3770, 15064, 323, 19513, 37310, 11, 2225, 389, 220, 2166, 13, 4487, 14283, 41925, 12850, 617, 31394, 11493, 35938, 304, 459, 9974, 6130, 24617, 10795, 11, 449, 3842, 21256, 320, 1213, 6945, 8, 2728, 279, 8592, 5573, 13, 4452, 11, 1455, 315, 279, 220, 806, 12850, 304, 279, 7230, 4036, 1193, 2380, 9958, 369, 4732, 11, 449, 19513, 37310, 3794, 1403, 323, 1193, 11463, 7972, 323, 32889, 8191, 20413, 3116, 13, 16299, 30, 49098, 220, 16, 11, 23776, 41925, 3932, 304, 6790, 323, 6186, 13, 578, 11761, 1912, 6944, 13172, 48011, 82, 311, 67845, 5718, 311, 6106, 46841, 41925, 25753, 810, 15499, 2489, 1455, 6444, 6, 3217, 13, 25122, 12850, 649, 51936, 25753, 430, 1193, 220, 605, 824, 2960, 315, 6444, 3604, 5371, 13, 27643, 388, 527, 8260, 369, 13172, 4732, 8349, 1778, 439, 596, 3550, 9533, 6, 311, 387, 10484, 1908, 555, 12850, 11, 6444, 311, 387, 2728, 5439, 4732, 17989, 520, 279, 1212, 315, 279, 5226, 449, 459, 13687, 16430, 369, 872, 3927, 2686, 323, 3932, 311, 387, 5535, 311, 4974, 17517, 2085, 16750, 422, 814, 656, 539, 636, 279, 8187, 4732, 13240, 520, 904, 1486, 304, 872, 5226, 13, 16299, 30, 6944, 13172, 48011, 82, 311, 67845, 5718, 311, 6106, 46841, 41925, 25753, 810, 15499, 2489, 1148, 374, 3604, 3984, 311, 6444, 320, 27581, 37260, 555, 1646, 8, 16299, 30, 11145, 7690, 12131, 46296, 1071, 25, 364, 10902, 14283, 20972, 527, 9564, 8294, 35938, 304, 872, 15508, 994, 433, 4131, 311, 279, 2532, 814, 3493, 779, 584, 1205, 311, 1518, 279, 2466, 4311, 709, 872, 1847, 13, 364, 2173, 884, 374, 1101, 5131, 34988, 420, 3157, 323, 584, 1457, 1205, 433, 311, 10765, 1268, 433, 6787, 311, 6106, 41925, 6444, 636, 264, 2731, 3568, 13, 364, 1687, 3077, 3309, 279, 13172, 48011, 82, 430, 5220, 1205, 311, 387, 1790, 49479, 449, 872, 6444, 922, 279, 25753, 814, 649, 1755, 13, 4452, 11, 2380, 4038, 389, 11, 584, 2351, 2103, 8748, 369, 1124, 311, 22203, 1268, 814, 3358, 6106, 88825, 1193, 1501, 279, 25753, 1455, 6444, 3604, 5371, 22438, 19791, 25], prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

As well as their sophisticated diet and their relaxed attitude to life, the women of the French capital have a few key rules to dressing that mean they nail it every time. Natalie Portman, who is married to the French dancer and choreographer Benjamin Millepied, revealed one of the key style points in an interview this weekend that has previously been unknown by many - that Parisian women don't wear shorts. Scroll down for video. Natalie Portman, 33, who married a Frenchman, says that Parisians would never wear shorts in the city. She told the Wisconsin Gazette: 'The city is so rich in terms of the architecture, the bookshops you find at every corner, the way everyone dresses so well. 'No Parisian ever walks around in shorts and even the children look very chic.' Parisians haven't just abolished shorts, they also steer clear of high heels, matching accessories and would never, ever been seen in a pair of tracksuit bottoms. Read on to discover the top tips Parisian women have for looking chic... Actress Vanessa Paradis attends a film premiere in head-to-toe black, a regular choice for Parisian women. Embrace black. Black is the overwhelming shade in every Parisian woman's wardrobe. It is key to make sure that you appear effortless and to guarantee that your clothes won't clash. Lay off the accessories. While British women are all about quantity, the French are the opposite - jewellery is understated. Avoid piling it on too - as Coco Chanel once said: 'Before leaving the house, a lady should look in the mirror and remove one accessory.' Coco Chanel advised never to overload on accessories. Invest in some scarves. When it comes to scarves, the accessory rule does not apply. Parisian women love scarves and sometimes even wear two at a time by twisting them together. Don't try too hard. Parisian women are polished but never let it show. Their messy hair, often un-tucked shirts and barely-there make-up are all part of a conscious effort to look as though they have given little thought to their appearance. Lou Doillon always looks effortlessly chic, with a slightly crumpled appearance. Invest in wardrobe staples. There are some basic items of clothing that feature in every Parisian woman's wardrobe. They include a white shirt, a black leather jacket, a little back dress, a fitted blazer, a black pencil skirt and a pair of cigarette pants. These are then worn for years and adapted to changing figures using a seamstress, unlike British women, who would head out and buy the item in a different size. The items can be made to look different and more modern by pairing them with on-trend accessories. Don't be too matchy matchy. Unless we're talking about black. French women don't match their accessories - shoes can be a different texture and even a different colour to a belt or a handbag. Mario Cotillard plays by the Parisian rule of unmatched accessories. Learn to love flats. French women love flat shoes. They will wear heels in the evening, but during the day they wear ballet pumps, moccasins or biker boots. A woman who is hobbling in her heels will look unglamourous no matter how hard she has tried. Try out masculine tailoring. Women like Lou Doillon always look effortlessly chic in their masculine tailoring.

Please output the summary only, without any other text.\n\nArticle:\nA prominent Muslim leader has lashed out at the Jewish community, calling them 'the most evil creatures of Allah'. The spokesman for Islamic extremist group Hizb ut-Tahrir, Ismail al-Wahwah, delivered the rant in an online video posted on March 3. He went on further to say recognising the Jewish people and giving them 'even a single inch of Palestine' would be the 'epitome of evil' as it would'strengthen that cancerous entity'. The spokesman for Islamic extremist group Hizb ut-Tahrir, Ismail al-Wahwah, delivered the rant in an online video posted on March 3. 'The Jews are the most evil creatures of Allah. Moral corruption is linked to the Jews,' Mr al-Wahwah said. 'They will pay with blood for blood, with tears for tears, and with destruction for destruction.' The surfacing of this video follows the NSW Jewish Board of Deputies (JBOD) filing a complaint with the NSW Anti-Discrimination Board against the extremist group. It was in relation to comments made last year at a rally in Lakemba, where Mr al-Wahwah said Jewish people all around the world were corrupt and they were a 'hidden evil', The Australian Jewish News\xa0reported. JBOD president Jeremy Spinak called on the Anti-Discrimination Board to write a brief up for the public prosecutions department so it could bring charges against Mr al-Wahwah and his fellow spokesman Wassim Doureihi. 'The speech incited hatred towards, serious contempt for, and severe ridicule of, Jews on the ground of them being Jewish,' Mr Spinak wrote. NSW JBOD chief executive Vic Alhadeff said he also feared speeches like al-Wahwah would lead to more local terror attacks. 'The speech incited hatred towards, serious contempt for, and severe ridicule of, Jews on the ground of them being Jewish.' NSW Communities Minister Victor Dominello has also written to the Anti-Discrimination Board to alert them to al-Wahwah's latest video, The Australian\xa0reported. Mr Dominello said despite the fact Australians enjoy freedom of speech, it should not be abused in this way. He labelled the video as 'deeply disturbing' as well as 'hateful and derisive'. '[It] has no place in our harmonious multicultural society,' Mr Dominello told News Corp. NSW JBOD chief executive Vic Alhadeff said he also feared speeches like al-Wahwah would lead to more local terror attacks. The surfacing of this video follows the NSW Jewish Board of Deputies (JBOD) filing a complaint with the NSW Anti-Discrimination Board against the extremist group. A Hizb ut-Tahrir spokesman said comments made on behalf of the group had to be assessed on the 'the context of an ongoing and bloody occupation of Palestine', referring to the Gaza conflict (above) 'This has nothing to do with Israel and is in the same vein of Islamic extremism and incitement that IS [Islamic State] peddles,' Mr Alhadeff said. 'It's another wake-up call for the authorities to act before these hate preachers inspire the next [Sydney Siege gunman] Man Monis.' Hizb ut-Tahrir jumped to the defence of Mr al-Wahwah, saying his comments made last year were made during the'most recent offensive against the people of Gaza', which 'indiscriminately razed homes, schools, hospitals and mosques'. The group's Tuesday statement also said the JBOD was 'falsely exploiting the words of Hizb ut-Tahrir'. Hamzah Qureshi, a Hizb ut-Tahrir spokesman, told News Corp on Wednesday comments made on behalf of the group had to be assessed on the 'the context of an ongoing and bloody occupation of Palestine by the illegitimate Israeli army'.\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0,

Please output the summary only, without any other text.\n\nArticle:\nHealth officials say people should eat less sugar. But that's easier said than done. Anyone who has tried cutting down on sugar knows to avoid cookies, sodas and candy. But sugar can be hidden in lots of other common packaged foods. The World Health Organization finalized guidelines Wednesday saying people should keep intake of added sugars to just five to ten per cent of overall calories, which translates to about 25 to 50 grams of sugar a day for most people. Scroll down for video. Be warned: According to experts, many supermarket soup varieties can contain up to two teaspoons of sugar in just one can. The guidelines don't apply to naturally occurring sugars in fruits, vegetables and milk, since they come with essential nutrients. In the U.S., adults get about 11 to 15 per cent of their calories from sugar; the figure for children tops that at about 16 per cent. By comparison, sugar intakes ranges in Europe from about seven per cent in Hungary to nearly 25 percent in Portugal. But research indicates that many people aren't aware of how much sugar they're eating every day. In fact, that's one reason the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is proposing the first overhaul of nutrition labels in two decades. In addition to highlighting the number of calories per serving in a bigger, bolder font, the new proposed labels would also for the first time list sugars that are added by manufacturers. Healthy? While salad might seem like the healthy option, the dressings used to add flavor to them are often loaded with sugars. In the meantime, though, companies don't currently disclose how much of the sugar listed in the nutrition panels of their products are from added sugars rather than naturally occurring ones. According to health experts, many everyday food products, which some might perceive to be completely healthy, are actually loaded with hidden sugars. Salad dressings, soups, yogurts and cereals have all been named as some of the worst offenders when it comes to sugar content; the popular Deluxe French salad dressing from Wish-Bone, for example, has four grams of sugar per serving - meaning it has around one teaspoon of sugar for every two tablespoons of dressing. Similarly, Progresso's Rich and Hearty Beef Pot Roast contains four grams of sugar per serving which means there are approximately two teaspoons of sugar in every can. 'In reality, we find (these sugars) in the majority of products,' Francesco Branca, who heads the World Health Oganization's Department of Nutrition for Health and Development, said. SALAD DRESSING: Picking a salad over a ham sandwich seems like a virtuous choice. But the amount of sugar it comes with can vary depending on the dressing you put on top of it. Wish-Bone's Deluxe French salad dressing, for instance, lists four grams (about one teaspoon) of sugar per serving (two tablespoons). SOUP: A cup of soup of soup is comforting thought, but even savory varieties can have sugar. A can of Progresso's Rich and Hearty Beef Pot Roast has four grams (about one teaspoon) of sugar per serving, with a can containing two servings. YOGURT: Another seemingly healthful choice that can come with lots of sugar. Some of the sugar is naturally occurring from the dairy, but companies add sweeteners too. A container of Chobani's 0% Fat Greek yogurt in black cherry flavor lists 17 grams (about four teaspoons) of sugar. BREAD: That toast you're about to smother with jam might've already been a little sweetened. A store brand of enriched white bread at the convenience store chain Duane Reade listed two grams (about half a teaspoon) of sugar for per serving (two slices). PEANUT BUTTER: It depends on the variety you pick, but peanut butter can come with added sugar too. Skippy's Super Chunk variety lists seven grams (almost two teaspoons) of sugar per serving (two tablespoons). CEREAL: Most people know that cereal has sugar, especially the varieties for kids. In some cases, you might be surprised that there isn't much difference between options. Special K with Red Berries, for instance, has nine grams (more than two teaspoons) per serving (one cup), while Frosted Flakes has ten grams (more than two teaspoons) of sugar per serving (3/4 cup). FROZEN MEALS: In case it wasn't clear by now, just because it's not dessert doesn't mean it doesn't have added sugar. California Kitchen's BBQ Chicken microwavable pizza has seven grams (almost two teaspoons) of sugar in a single-serving pie.\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0,

Please output the summary only, without any other text.\n\nArticle:\nDespite the recent news that Ryanair had been given approval to offer low-cost flights from Europe to America, it seems that such a project may not be in the works after all. A statement, issued from Dublin, Ireland, shot down recent speculation about budget flights to the US. 'In light of recent press coverage, the Board of Ryanair Holdings Plc wishes to clarify that it has not considered or approved any transatlantic project and does not intend to do so,' it reads. Despite earlier reports that Ryanair was developing low-cost transatlantic flights, the company is now denying such plans. However, it is understood that the ideas of such a transatlantic project is still being explored, but with the intention that Ryanair would not operate the flights. Instead, any sort of budget Europe to America service, should it come into fruition, would be operated by a sister company under a separate brand. Earlier this week, it was reported that Ireland-based budget carrier was moving forward on plans to run services between key European cities and the US with one-way tickets costing as little as $15 (£10). The news came on the heels of a statement made by Michael O'Leary, the airline's chief executive, last year. He told the Irish Hotels Federation conference that Ryanair would be offering $15 flights to Boston and New York, but also admitted that passengers would be expected to pay extra for everything from meals to baggage. Chief executive Michael O'Leary, has said that $15 flights were in development but 'four or five years off' 'Not every seat will be ($15) of course; there will also need to be a very high number of business or premium seats,' he reportedly said. He's also said in the past that the company has had a business plan in development for low-fare, transatlantic flights for awhile, but would need to wait until new aircraft could be ordered. 'The difficulty is, I keep cautioning, is that there's no availability of long-haul aircraft for another four or five years.' It remains to be seen whether or not Ryanair's possible plan will develop further or if a new sister company will emerge.\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=128, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=False, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: [128000, 9370, 5730, 553, 279, 2768, 3754, 4652, 304, 220, 4386, 11460, 13, 5321, 2612, 279, 12399, 1193, 11, 2085, 904, 1023, 1495, 382, 17064, 512, 20397, 279, 3293, 3754, 430, 13960, 1334, 1047, 1027, 2728, 14765, 311, 3085, 3428, 41238, 25952, 505, 4606, 311, 5270, 11, 433, 5084, 430, 1778, 264, 2447, 1253, 539, 387, 304, 279, 4375, 1306, 682, 13, 362, 5224, 11, 11136, 505, 33977, 11, 14990, 11, 6689, 1523, 3293, 33422, 922, 8199, 25952, 311, 279, 2326, 13, 364, 644, 3177, 315, 3293, 3577, 10401, 11, 279, 8925, 315, 13960, 1334, 54642, 1856, 66, 25223, 311, 38263, 430, 433, 706, 539, 6646, 477, 12054, 904, 1380, 60435, 8322, 2447, 323, 1587, 539, 30730, 311, 656, 779, 2965, 433, 16181, 13, 18185, 6931, 6821, 430, 13960, 1334, 574, 11469, 3428, 41238, 1380, 60435, 8322, 25952, 11, 279, 2883, 374, 1457, 41566, 1778, 6787, 13, 4452, 11, 433, 374, 16365, 430, 279, 6848, 315, 1778, 264, 1380, 60435, 8322, 2447, 374, 2103, 1694, 36131, 11, 719, 449, 279, 14944, 430, 13960, 1334, 1053, 539, 14816, 279, 25952, 13, 12361, 11, 904, 3460, 315, 8199, 4606, 311, 5270, 2532, 11, 1288, 433, 2586, 1139, 94706, 11, 1053, 387, 24026, 555, 264, 13219, 2883, 1234, 264, 8821, 6883, 13, 47993, 420, 2046, 11, 433, 574, 5068, 430, 14990, 6108, 8199, 19115, 574, 7366, 4741, 389, 6787, 311, 1629, 3600, 1990, 1401, 7665, 9919, 323, 279, 2326, 449, 832, 27896, 14741, 54824, 439, 2697, 439, 400, 868, 54915, 605, 570, 578, 3754, 3782, 389, 279, 34460, 315, 264, 5224, 1903, 555, 8096, 507, 6, 2356, 661, 11, 279, 33575, 596, 10388, 11145, 11, 1566, 1060, 13, 1283, 3309, 279, 18088, 45871, 28331, 10017, 430, 13960, 1334, 1053, 387, 10209, 400, 868, 25952, 311, 10406, 323, 1561, 4356, 11, 719, 1101, 16584, 430, 22961, 1053, 387, 3685, 311, 2343, 5066, 369, 4395, 505, 21644, 311, 61649, 13, 14681, 11145, 8096, 507, 6, 2356, 661, 11, 706, 1071, 430, 400, 868, 25952, 1051, 304, 4500, 719, 364, 35124, 477, 4330, 1667, 1022, 6, 364, 2688, 1475, 10954, 690, 387, 1746, 868, 8, 315, 3388, 26, 1070, 690, 1101, 1205, 311, 387, 264, 1633, 1579, 1396, 315, 2626, 477, 15193, 16712, 2965, 568, 18307, 1071, 13, 1283, 596, 1101, 1071, 304, 279, 3347, 430, 279, 2883, 706, 1047, 264, 2626, 3197, 304, 4500, 369, 3428, 2269, 548, 11, 1380, 60435, 8322, 25952, 369, 51569, 11, 719, 1053, 1205, 311, 3868, 3156, 502, 14467, 1436, 387, 11713, 13, 364, 791, 17250, 374, 11, 358, 2567, 28930, 287, 11, 374, 430, 1070, 596, 912, 18539, 315, 1317, 2902, 5049, 14467, 369, 2500, 3116, 477, 4330, 1667, 3238, 1102, 8625, 311, 387, 3970, 3508, 477, 539, 13960, 1334, 596, 3284, 3197, 690, 2274, 4726, 477, 422, 264, 502, 13219, 2883, 690, 34044, 382, 19791, 25], prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

The unnamed 32-year-old  Chechen national had been living in Maastricht in the southern Netherlands before taking her young son and daughter to ISIS' de facto capital Raqqa. The father of the missing children named the pair as Luca, seven, and his sister Aysha, eight, and said they had been taken without his consent. The woman's two other children are believed to have been handed over to a relative before she left to join the terror group. Abducted: The father of the missing children named the pair as 'Luca', seven, (left) and his sister 'Aysha', eight, (right) and said they had been taken without his consent. The missing woman, who has not yet been named, fled the Netherlands with two of her children last October,\xa0the Dutch prosecution's office confirmed this morning. Snatched: Eight-year-old Dutch girl 'Aysha' was abducted by her mother and taken to join ISIS. It is the first known instance of children in the Netherlands being abducted and taken to join ISIS. According to the Dutch newspaper\xa0De Limburger, the children's father had previously reported his estranged wife to the police because he was concerned she was planning to travel to Syria. Officers are said to have questioned the woman several times but she denied having intentions to join ISIS and investigators could find no evidence of concrete travel plans. Shortly afterwards the woman vanished from\xa0Maastricht with two of the children, prompting Dutch officials to launch a major alert, leading to an international arrest warrant being issued. Despite this the woman later took to Facebook to declare that she and her two children had arrived in the terrorists' de facto capital Raqqa, having used fake passports to travel across Europe. After making the announcement of their arrival in Raqqa on Facebook last October, nothing has been heard from the trio since. Dutch officials said they had no way of telling whether the group were still alive, with\xa0prosecutor Bart den Hartigh declaring the recovery of the children 'impossible' as\xa0the Netherlands has no legal relationship with either the Syrian regime or the terror group that controls the city of Raqqa. No place for children: The unnamed 32-year-old Chechen national had been living in Maastricht in the southern Netherlands before taking her young son and daughter to ISIS' de facto capital Raqqa (pictured) The news comes as an 18-year-old man has been arrested at his home in Birmingham on suspicion of preparing to travel to Syria to join the Islamic State. West Midland Police have said the teenager, from the Hodge Hill area of Birmingham, was arrested at around 7am today by officers from the West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit. It comes the day after it three British teenage jihadists were arrested in Turkey on suspicion of trying to join Islamic State fighters in Syria, in a dramatic security operation. A pair of 17-year-old schoolboys and a 19-year-old man were intercepted in Istanbul after their parents realised they had fled to join the terrorist group. They dialled 999 and British police quickly tipped off their Turkish counterparts. Officials swooped on the group within minutes of their flight touching down in Istanbul.\xa0The three were brought back to Britain where they were questioned  on suspicion of preparing acts of terrorism.\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=128, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=False, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: [128000, 9370, 5730, 553, 279, 2768, 3754, 4652, 304, 220, 4386, 11460, 13, 5321, 2612, 279, 12399, 1193, 11, 2085, 904, 1023, 1495, 382, 17064, 512, 32, 24113, 6691, 706, 84545, 1403, 315, 1077, 3116, 2911, 323, 4529, 1124, 311, 5249, 39449, 11039, 369, 279, 15558, 3314, 20320, 22139, 304, 12911, 13, 578, 53873, 220, 843, 4771, 6418, 220, 8602, 7674, 5426, 1047, 1027, 5496, 304, 386, 5418, 496, 4970, 304, 279, 18561, 26746, 1603, 4737, 1077, 3995, 4538, 323, 10003, 311, 23474, 6, 409, 61596, 6864, 98960, 13, 578, 7126, 315, 279, 7554, 2911, 7086, 279, 6857, 439, 84278, 11, 8254, 11, 323, 813, 13219, 24852, 15605, 11, 8223, 11, 323, 1071, 814, 1047, 1027, 4529, 2085, 813, 14771, 13, 578, 5333, 596, 1403, 1023, 2911, 527, 11846, 311, 617, 1027, 23415, 927, 311, 264, 8844, 1603, 1364, 2163, 311, 5249, 279, 8818, 1912, 13, 3765, 55015, 25, 578, 7126, 315, 279, 7554, 2911, 7086, 279, 6857, 439, 364, 50302, 936, 518, 8254, 11, 320, 2414, 8, 323, 813, 13219, 364, 74209, 15605, 518, 8223, 11, 320, 1315, 8, 323, 1071, 814, 1047, 1027, 4529, 2085, 813, 14771, 13, 578, 7554, 5333, 11, 889, 706, 539, 3686, 1027, 7086, 11, 30010, 279, 26746, 449, 1403, 315, 1077, 2911, 1566, 6664, 11, 4194, 1820, 24113, 32699, 596, 5274, 11007, 420, 6693, 13, 13358, 35344, 25, 36944, 4771, 6418, 24113, 3828, 364, 74209, 15605, 6, 574, 84545, 555, 1077, 6691, 323, 4529, 311, 5249, 23474, 13, 1102, 374, 279, 1176, 3967, 2937, 315, 2911, 304, 279, 26746, 1694, 84545, 323, 4529, 311, 5249, 23474, 13, 10771, 311, 279, 24113, 17222, 4194, 1951, 13903, 63552, 11, 279, 2911, 596, 7126, 1047, 8767, 5068, 813, 30607, 3811, 7555, 311, 279, 4379, 1606, 568, 574, 11920, 1364, 574, 9293, 311, 5944, 311, 12911, 13, 49947, 527, 1071, 311, 617, 29440, 279, 5333, 3892, 3115, 719, 1364, 15164, 3515, 34334, 311, 5249, 23474, 323, 26453, 1436, 1505, 912, 6029, 315, 14509, 5944, 6787, 13, 67587, 27905, 279, 5333, 59581, 505, 111658, 5418, 496, 4970, 449, 1403, 315, 279, 2911, 11, 50745, 24113, 7510, 311, 7195, 264, 3682, 5225, 11, 6522, 311, 459, 6625, 8163, 7236, 1694, 11136, 13, 18185, 420, 279, 5333, 3010, 3952, 311, 5690, 311, 16292, 430, 1364, 323, 1077, 1403, 2911, 1047, 11721, 304, 279, 29331, 6, 409, 61596, 6864, 98960, 11, 3515, 1511, 12700, 75526, 311, 5944, 4028, 4606, 13, 4740, 3339, 279, 17480, 315, 872, 19163, 304, 98960, 389, 5690, 1566, 6664, 11, 4400, 706, 1027, 6755, 505, 279, 35062, 2533, 13, 24113, 7510, 1071, 814, 1047, 912, 1648, 315, 11890, 3508, 279, 1912, 1051, 2103, 13989, 11, 449, 4194, 782, 5132, 4936, 29627, 3453, 23750, 1108, 37631, 279, 13654, 315, 279, 2911, 364, 318, 10236, 6, 439, 4194, 1820, 26746, 706, 912, 5897, 5133, 449, 3060, 279, 18636, 17942, 477, 279, 8818, 1912, 430, 11835, 279, 3363, 315, 98960, 13, 2360, 2035, 369, 2911, 25, 578, 53873, 220, 843, 4771, 6418, 8602, 7674, 5426, 1047, 1027, 5496, 304, 386, 5418, 496, 4970, 304, 279, 18561, 26746, 1603, 4737, 1077, 3995, 4538, 323, 10003, 311, 23474, 6, 409, 61596, 6864, 98960, 320, 69389, 8, 578, 3754, 4131, 439, 459, 220, 972, 4771, 6418, 893, 706, 1027, 12800, 520, 813, 2162, 304, 36937, 389, 38141, 315, 20646, 311, 5944, 311, 12911, 311, 5249, 279, 15558, 3314, 13, 4410, 14013, 1974, 10289, 617, 1071, 279, 32639, 11, 505, 279, 473, 15912, 8270, 3158, 315, 36937, 11, 574, 12800, 520, 2212, 220, 22, 309, 3432, 555, 9808, 505, 279, 4410, 81251, 20315, 80764, 8113, 13, 1102, 4131, 279, 1938, 1306, 433, 2380, 8013, 34268, 94380, 1051, 12800, 304, 17442, 389, 38141, 315, 4560, 311, 5249, 15558, 3314, 24080, 304, 12911, 11, 304, 264, 22520, 4868, 5784, 13, 362, 6857, 315, 220, 1114, 4771, 6418, 2978, 30123, 323, 264, 220, 777, 4771, 6418, 893, 1051, 70474, 304, 54468, 1306, 872, 6699, 41193, 814, 1047, 30010, 311, 5249, 279, 20320, 1912, 13, 2435, 28960, 839, 220, 5500, 323, 8013, 4379, 6288, 66472, 1022, 872, 24666, 38495, 13, 64239, 34227, 16771, 389, 279, 1912, 2949, 4520, 315, 872, 11213, 31687, 1523, 304, 54468, 13, 4194, 791, 2380, 1051, 7263, 1203, 311, 13527, 1405, 814, 1051, 29440, 220, 389, 38141, 315, 20646, 14385, 315, 24020, 382, 19791, 25], prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

Former Gunners striker Alan Sunderland emigrated there 20 years ago after his life in England turned sour but he still follows Arsenal’s fortunes and returns two or three times a year as a guest of the club. ‘When Arsenal play a big game, I have to watch on my own, I’m nervous if I am around fans of the other teams,’ he said. Yet he showed no sign of nerves in 1979 when he slid in to win the Cup for Arsenal. Alan Sunderland celebrates scoring the winning goal for Arsenal in the 1979 FA Cup final at Wembley. Sunderland's 89th minute goal handed Arsenal a 3-2 victory over Manchester United at Wembley. Sunderland, 61, said: ‘The night before the final, an Arsenal fan at our hotel gave all the players a silver dollar as a lucky token — I’ve still got mine!’ But his luck ran out after he retired through injury at the age of 36 having played for Wolves, Arsenal and Ipswich. He went through a divorce, was given a driving ban that hindered coaching opportunities and drifted from jobs in insurance, pubs and letting. Then, despite having three children in England, he decided on a radical change. He had an apartment in Malta as a holiday home and 20 years ago decided to stay. He said: ‘It’s an easy life, the island is small and you’ve got the sea.’ Arsenal hero Sunderland pictured outside of the modern day Wembley stadium. Sunderland (centre) pictured slotting in the winning goal for Arsenal in the 1979 final against United. He admits to being a solitary person but he is still recognised by fans after that late winner. ‘People talk about my hair in all the pictures from the final,’ he added. ‘Everyone had perms then but mine was naturally frizzy. ‘It’s getting a bit rough and wiry again as it happens. I must get it cut!’\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=128, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=False, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: [128000, 9370, 5730, 553, 279, 2768, 3754, 4652, 304, 220, 4386, 11460, 13, 5321, 2612, 279, 12399, 1193, 11, 2085, 904, 1023, 1495, 382, 17064, 512, 8142, 19922, 3723, 323, 33102, 3449, 520, 10846, 95746, 389, 7159, 11, 279, 2489, 27875, 12084, 315, 279, 220, 4468, 24, 15358, 11098, 1620, 1990, 279, 19424, 690, 387, 10307, 304, 99544, 1403, 16579, 8931, 3201, 304, 61750, 13, 33600, 22450, 5079, 45041, 26349, 83765, 991, 95930, 1070, 220, 508, 1667, 4227, 1306, 813, 2324, 304, 9635, 6656, 20897, 719, 568, 2103, 11263, 33102, 753, 68603, 323, 4780, 1403, 477, 2380, 3115, 264, 1060, 439, 264, 8810, 315, 279, 6469, 13, 3451, 4599, 33102, 1514, 264, 2466, 1847, 11, 358, 617, 311, 3821, 389, 856, 1866, 11, 358, 4344, 23418, 422, 358, 1097, 2212, 7359, 315, 279, 1023, 7411, 23189, 568, 1071, 13, 14968, 568, 8710, 912, 1879, 315, 50581, 304, 220, 4468, 24, 994, 568, 61014, 304, 311, 3243, 279, 11098, 369, 33102, 13, 26349, 83765, 49193, 20413, 279, 11230, 5915, 369, 33102, 304, 279, 220, 4468, 24, 15358, 11098, 1620, 520, 468, 92729, 88, 13, 83765, 596, 220, 4578, 339, 9568, 5915, 23415, 33102, 264, 220, 18, 12, 17, 12845, 927, 19922, 3723, 520, 468, 92729, 88, 13, 83765, 11, 220, 5547, 11, 1071, 25, 3451, 791, 3814, 1603, 279, 1620, 11, 459, 33102, 8571, 520, 1057, 9689, 6688, 682, 279, 4311, 264, 15310, 18160, 439, 264, 18069, 4037, 2001, 358, 4070, 2103, 2751, 10705, 72434, 2030, 813, 15369, 10837, 704, 1306, 568, 22311, 1555, 11134, 520, 279, 4325, 315, 220, 1927, 3515, 6476, 369, 64579, 11, 33102, 323, 90062, 17316, 13, 1283, 4024, 1555, 264, 25549, 11, 574, 2728, 264, 10043, 9120, 430, 57780, 291, 24826, 10708, 323, 92662, 505, 7032, 304, 8276, 11, 74862, 323, 20806, 13, 5112, 11, 8994, 3515, 2380, 2911, 304, 9635, 11, 568, 6773, 389, 264, 18336, 2349, 13, 1283, 1047, 459, 13455, 304, 61750, 439, 264, 13560, 2162, 323, 220, 508, 1667, 4227, 6773, 311, 4822, 13, 1283, 1071, 25, 3451, 2181, 753, 459, 4228, 2324, 11, 279, 13218, 374, 2678, 323, 499, 4070, 2751, 279, 9581, 14639, 33102, 12084, 83765, 42666, 4994, 315, 279, 6617, 1938, 468, 92729, 88, 24833, 13, 83765, 320, 75217, 8, 42666, 9633, 1303, 304, 279, 11230, 5915, 369, 33102, 304, 279, 220, 4468, 24, 1620, 2403, 3723, 13, 1283, 38239, 311, 1694, 264, 58229, 1732, 719, 568, 374, 2103, 39764, 555, 7359, 1306, 430, 3389, 13946, 13, 3451, 16298, 3137, 922, 856, 7013, 304, 682, 279, 9364, 505, 279, 1620, 23189, 568, 3779, 13, 3451, 34124, 1047, 83382, 1243, 719, 10705, 574, 18182, 1448, 91591, 13, 3451, 2181, 753, 3794, 264, 2766, 11413, 323, 16502, 88, 1578, 439, 433, 8741, 13, 358, 2011, 636, 433, 4018, 0, 30184, 19791, 25], prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

The increase in risk per 10g of alcohol consumed – around one alcoholic drink – is about 4 per cent, says the World Cancer Research Fund. As a result three or more drinks pose a significant cancer risk, it adds. The review also found a strong association between obesity and liver cancer, as well as evidence that drinking coffee can protect against the disease. The risk of liver cancer is increased by 4 per cent for every 10g of alcohol consumed, meaning three or more drinks a day pose a significant cancer risk, a research review has claimed. The WCRF's continuous update project reviewed global research into the relationship between diet, weight and physical activity, and liver cancer. In all, 34 studies were analysed covering 8.2million people of whom more than 24,500 had liver cancer. Previous research by the project has shown alcohol to be strongly linked with a range of cancers, including liver. The WCRF recommends women should try to limit their alcohol intake to one drink per day and men to two. Amanda McLean, director of WCRF UK, said: 'Around three or more drinks per day can be enough to cause liver cancer. Until now we were uncertain about the amount of alcohol likely to lead to liver cancer. But the research reviewed in this report is strong enough to be more specific.' In 2012, there were 4,703 cases of liver cancer in the UK. The report estimates that nearly a quarter of cases could be prevented if people kept a healthy weight and did not drink. World Cancer Research Fund reviewed 34 studies involving more than 8.2million people in order to reach its findings on alcohol, weight, physical activity and liver cancer. Although the research found strong evidence that drinking coffee can reduce the risk of the disease, the report did not recommend the amount that should be drunk. Professor Sir Ian Gilmore, chairman of the Alcohol Health Alliance UK, said: 'The findings from this study further demonstrate the urgent need for mandatory health warnings on alcohol products.' Dr Sarah Jarvis, medical adviser for alcohol education charity Drinkaware, said the research revealed a worrying link with obesity, but some people had a 'blind spot' when it comes to the calories in alcohol. She added: 'To help reduce the risk of getting alcohol-related liver cancer, it is best to drink within the lower-risk guidelines of 2-3 units a day for women, that's a 175ml glass of 13 per cent wine, or 3-4 units a day for men, a pint and a half of 4 per cent beer.' Sir David Spiegelhalter, Winton professor of the public understanding of risk, University of Cambridge, said that while the increase in risk of liver cancer per 10g of alcohol consumed was about 4 per cent, that level of alcohol was 'extremely unlikely to cause cancer', especially as the report says the increase in risk only starts at levels above 5.5 units a day. He added: 'Liver cancer is rare: about one in 100 men and one in 200 women get it. So if you already drink a lot, and then drink even more, your risk goes up a small amount.' Paul Pharoah, professor of cancer epidemiology, University of Cambridge, said the evidence appeared to show three drinks a day led to 'a very small' absolute increase in risk from ten in 1,000 to 12 in 1,000 for men and 5 in 1,000 to 5.6 in 1,000 for women. He added: 'Even though the data specifically related to primary liver cancer do not support the recommendation to limit alcohol intake to one drink a day for women and two for men, there are plenty of other reasons to support the recommendations.'\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0,

The 35-year-old wasn't celebrating a cup triumph but the millions flowing through his accounts from an alleged £30million investment scheme that snared a string of top-flight players. Pictures have now emerged of McIndoe in 2011 - at the height of his scheme - surrounded by beautiful women and empty champagne bottles as he revelled in a millionaire playboy's lifestyle in Marbella with a limitless credit card and wads of cash. Former Wolves and \xa0Coventry player Michael McIndoe celebrates in Marbella during the height of his scheme. A member of staff at the beach bar lifts a\xa0Methuselah champagne bottle out of an ice bucket. Another former footballer revealed that McIndoe had spent £40,000 on champagne in one day. McIndoe (second from the right) parties in Marbella using money earned from the elaborate scheme. McIndoe started out at Luton Town, making his debut in 1998 and playing for the Hatters 39 times before joining Hereford on a free in 2000. Yeovil then took advantage of the Bulls' financial plight and snapped him up for £25,000 the following year. He scored 22 goals in 91 outings for the Glovers, winning promotion from the Conference in 2003 before joining Doncaster for £50,000. McIndoe twice made the PFA Team of the Year with Rovers and was his side's joint-top scorer in 2004-05 with 12 goals. He twice represented the Scotland B side during his time at Rovers. After a loan spell at Derby he joined Barnsley then Wolves, on loan again, before the deal was made permanent for £250,000. He signed a three-year contract with Bristol City in 2007 and scored the winner against Crystal Palace in the second leg of the 2008 Championship play-off semi-final. They lost out to Hull at Wembley and McIndoe had one more season at Ashton Gate before joining Coventry. He also had a brief loan stint at MK Dons. But the former Wolves and Coventry midfielder, who is accused of persuading 300 stars including Jimmy Bullard as well as a string of lower league players to invest with him, is now being investigated by police. He was forced into a bankruptcy court with debts approaching £3m earlier this month where he claimed to be penniless and living on the charity of friends and family. The Metropolitan Police are investigating and have started quizzing victims and associates. 'He was the Mr Big in Marbella, buying loads of champagne and girls all over the place. He even had a bodyguard,' said one footballer, who lost around £75,000 in the scheme, which promised a 20 per cent return on investments. McIndoe, from Edinburgh, hired pop star Alexandra Burke to perform at a party and invested in a private members club, in London. But it was in Marbella that McIndoe indulged the lavish lifestyle - shown in these exclusive photos - he could not afford as his playing career ended in non-league football. He hired a modernist £2m mansion for £27,000-a-week for a three-week holiday spree and spent £40,000 on champagne in one day at a beach club party. Friends had bottles of champagne and vodka at their tables whenever they went to nightclubs. McIndoe celebrates scoring for Doncaster against Arsenal in the League Cup in 2005. McIndoe with the girlfriend\xa0Emma Frain during one of his holidays in Spain. McIndoe used the promise of 20 per cent returns on people's money to fund his champagne lifestyle. The former Scotland B player rented a £27,000-a-week mansion for a three-week holiday in Spain. 'There were lots of girls and lots of drink,' said the player, who had been befriended by McIndoe when he was a young apprentice at the same club. 'He was spending money like you've never seen before.' McIndoe was photographed lounging on a white sofa with his then girlfriend, model Emma Frain, and smoking a huge cigar while surrounded by friends as he bankrolled their luxury holidays. The player added that McIndoe targeted fellow professionals and businessmen football supporters and initially gave them the 20 per cent return paid monthly in cash. The scheme sucked in around 300 players and the former QPR and Hull star Bullard is thought to have lost around £600,000 which prompted him to go on the ITV reality show, I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out of Here. He told original investors to get other 'clients' involved and they would be rewarded. McIndoe and his friends at the Ocean Club in Marbella where 'beds' can cost up to 7,950 euros (£5,790) More than 60 bottles of Veuve Cliquot Champagne stand empty at a party funded by McIndoe in Marbella. Large bottles of the expensive Dom Perignon champagne are buried into an ice bucket. Jimmy Bullard (pictured here in 2011) was one of the investors, and is thought to have lost around £600,000. McIndoe lived at the five-star Mayfair Hotel, paying £4,000 a week for a suite, and also rented a Belgravia apartment for an upfront £150,000 annual fee, it is alleged. He ran glitzy parties at celebrity nightclubs including Funky Buddha, in London, and drove around in a Bentley and a Maybach. He was reportedly gambling heavily before the scheme crashed and is said to have run through £1m on bets with one bookmaker in a year. 'He had the gift of the gab but was very cagey about the scheme, saying the money was in property, gold or City investments,' added the player, who declined to be named. 'People were convinced when they saw him paying out but then he suddenly closed the scheme down. He kept telling me to wait and that I would be a wealthy man.' McIndoe celebrates sinking Crystal Palace to reach Wembley in 2008. But he was consoled by Wayne Brown after Bristol City lost the 2008 Championship Play-off final to Hull. Another person to have been caught out by the former Scotland B international was glamour model Georgia Eden, who was one of 30 women hired to attend club nights organised by McIndoe. In total, McIndoe was due to pay the model agency who organised the women £12,000, but the money never materialised. Speaking to the Daily Record, Eden said:\xa0'We were asked to mingle around and talk to guests in the club. The organisers said they were really pleased with what we had done and we were told we would be paid within 30 days. Georgia Eden was one of 30 models hired to attend a event put on at a club by McIndoe. But Eden, along with her colleagues, was never paid for her work with the agency said to be owed £12,000. McIndoe (right) in action playing for his former club Wolves against West Bromwich Albion in 2007. 'That date came and went and a lot of excuses were made to the agency. 'To have that amount of girls booked for one job was a really big deal so it was a big let down to not be paid for the work we had done.' McIndoe was made bankrupt in October last year with disclosed debts of £2.4m. He told the London bankruptcy court this month that he had no income and was living off £13,900 surplus from the sale of his mother's house but £6,000 of that had been given to his girlfriend, who lives in Epping, Essex. 'That money has been running thin of late so I have been getting help from friends and family,' he told the hearing. He added that he was not working and was living with his mother in Edinburgh or staying with a friend in London. After the hearing, he faced accusations from creditors that he had not responded to their questions about repayment. 'I have nothing to say, I cannot comment about this,' he said. The hearing was adjourned until March 25 and he must attend a meeting with the bankruptcy trustee later this month.

The footage could show scenes from any amusement park, anywhere in the world, yet it is a propaganda video designed to show the 'lighter' side of living under the bloodthirsty Islamic State caliphate. Shot in Dijla City, a fairground just north of the Iraqi city Mosul,\xa0children and adults describe life under ISIS control. Unsurprisingly, they are all very complimentary. Scroll down for video. Propaganda: Smiling children enjoy fairground rides at Dijla City in Islamic State's most recent propaganda video. The ISIS interviewer asks one child, who is standing alongside an armed companion, what his life is like under the Islamic State caliphate. The scenes could be from any park, anywhere in the world, but these children live under the control of ISIS. The video, entitled 'Citizens’ Days Out in the Shadow of the Islamic State' and published today, is an attempt to depict an idealised version of everyday life under the caliphate. Charlie Winter, a researcher at the Quilliam Foundation, a counter-extremism think tank, analysed the footage. 'In the video, we see men and children playing in Dijla City theme park, which is located just on the outside of Mosul in northern Iraq,' Mr Winter said. 'While it may seem a strange addition to IS’s propaganda repertoire, is nothing unusual. 'Just as they do in many other videos like this, the propagandists are peddling the idea that there has been a total reversal of the status quo for Sunni Muslims in IS-held territory. 'They are trying to promote the idea that the IS caliphate is a true utopia, where Sunni children are free to play safely, free from persecution and injustice. 'Safe to say, this is a heavily idealised version of events.' Fairground fun: Children and adults are asked by the interviewer what life is like under ISIS control and they are all very complimentary. Caliphate: If the footage were to be believed, children living under Islamic State rule live a good life and spend their days playing in the sun. Deceiving: A small boy waves at the camera in an Islamic State propaganda video and youngsters enjoy the fairground rides. All the fun of the ISIS:\xa0Shot in Dijla City, a fairground just north of the Iraqi city Mosul, children and adults what life is like under ISIS control. The ISIS interviewer asks one child, who is standing alongside an armed companion, what his life is like. He replies: 'It is a life that is comfortable and God has willed it that it is like this in the Islamic State, which will remain by the permission of God.' Another reveals it is'very good' and he is 'at ease'. A man, who carries a young girl in his arms, tells the interviewer: 'I mean, this situation is what God prefers, he is great, it is preferred by God the Almighty, all is good here, there is security that is enviable. 'Would we want more? There is a huge difference now, it is better than before.' One child tells the ISIS interviewer that life under the caliphate is'very good' and said he is 'at ease' and relaxed. A man, who carries a young girl in his arms, tells the interviewer: 'All is good here, there is security that is enviable. Would we want more? There is a huge difference now, it is better than before' Charlie Winter, a researcher at the Quilliam Foundation, a counter-extremism think tank, analysed the footage and said:\xa0'Safe to say, this is a heavily idealised version of events' Smiles: Youngsters are interviewed in the video and it is no surprise they are complimentary of bloodthirsty ISIS. The footage, which shows no women, couldn't be more different to chilling new images of a sword-wielding ISIS executioner publicly beheading three men\xa0accused of homosexuality and blasphemy, also in northern Iraq. The jihadist group, which controls swathes of Iraq and neighbouring Syria, has carried out hundreds of barbaric executions as it has imposed its brutal version of Islamic law, many of which are photographed or videotaped. The Sharia code of conduct is enforced in areas under its control ranging from 80 lashes for drinking alcohol and losing a hand for theft, to death for committing blasphemy.\n\nSummary:", params:

A Virginia mother shot an intruder to protect her two-year-old daughter after he broke into her family home. Allie (pictured right with her two-year-old daughter, left), who has not given her full name, is the wife of a James City County officer and said the incident happened on Wednesday around 10.30pm, an hour after her husband left for work. After the man, 25, broke through a window in her daughter's playroom, on instinct she grabbed her gun and fired two shots, injuring him (above her family home where the break in occurred) The man, who has not been identified, is recovering in hospital with life-threatening injuries, and could face a burglary charge once out, according to WTKR. Allie, who was trained by her husband on what to do during this type of incident, said the man started banging on her door and messing with the door knob while screaming things as he tried to get in. She said:\xa0'He was screaming like, 'Let me in baby, we are okay let me in, they are out to kill me,' I looked through the peephole and I didn't recognize who it was, so I latched the top lock, ran to the back, called 911 and got my gun.' While she went to a back room to retrieve her gun, she heard a crash as the man broke into the playroom, an area where her child was only 30 minutes before the incident. She had only recently put her child to bed. 'She could have been in here playing and he could have busted in and fell on her or anything,' she said. 'All I knew is I wanted to stop him from hurting me or hurting my daughter.' Allie, who was trained by her husband on what to do during this type of incident, said the man started banging on her door and messing with the door knob while screaming things as he tried to get in (above the window that the man broke through) Allie said while she went to retrieve her gun, she heard a crash as the man broke into the playroom, an area where her child was only 30 minutes before the incident (above the playroom where the intruder entered) Allie said the man was behaving\xa0erratically, as if he was under the influence of drugs, and was coming at her, which is when she fired the gun twice. The man was hit in his groin and a second bullet went through his hand and into his stomach. The mother said she kept the gun fixed on the intruder as she waited for responding officers to arrive, according to Fox and Friends. Both Allie and her daughter were safe following the incident, but Allie said she is happy knowing it was not her or her daughter that was left in the hospital. 'It was either him or me,' said Allie. 'I have my daughter to protect.'\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=128, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=False, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: [128000, 9370, 5730, 553, 279, 2768, 3754, 4652, 304, 220, 4386, 11460, 13, 5321, 2612, 279, 12399, 1193, 11, 2085, 904, 1023, 1495, 382, 17064, 512, 32, 13286, 6691, 6689, 459, 10805, 33719, 311, 6144, 1077, 1403, 4771, 6418, 10003, 1306, 568, 14760, 1139, 1077, 3070, 2162, 13, 2052, 648, 11, 889, 706, 539, 2728, 1077, 2539, 836, 11, 374, 279, 7555, 315, 264, 7957, 4409, 6406, 4379, 9640, 323, 1071, 279, 10672, 7077, 389, 8079, 2212, 220, 605, 13, 966, 5298, 11, 459, 6596, 1306, 1077, 10177, 2163, 369, 990, 13, 4740, 279, 893, 11, 220, 914, 11, 14760, 1555, 264, 3321, 304, 1077, 10003, 596, 1514, 3039, 11, 389, 31655, 1364, 30418, 1077, 6166, 323, 14219, 1403, 15300, 11, 86685, 1461, 13, 23198, 1523, 369, 2835, 13, 362, 13286, 6691, 6689, 459, 10805, 33719, 311, 6144, 1077, 1403, 4771, 6418, 10003, 1306, 568, 14760, 1139, 1077, 3070, 2162, 13, 2052, 648, 320, 69389, 1314, 449, 1077, 1403, 4771, 6418, 10003, 11, 2163, 705, 889, 706, 539, 2728, 1077, 2539, 836, 11, 374, 279, 7555, 315, 264, 7957, 4409, 6406, 9640, 323, 1071, 279, 10672, 7077, 389, 8079, 2212, 220, 605, 13, 966, 5298, 11, 459, 6596, 1306, 1077, 10177, 2163, 369, 990, 13, 4740, 279, 893, 11, 220, 914, 11, 14760, 1555, 264, 3321, 304, 1077, 10003, 596, 1514, 3039, 11, 389, 31655, 1364, 30418, 1077, 6166, 323, 14219, 1403, 15300, 11, 86685, 1461, 320, 49532, 1077, 3070, 2162, 1405, 279, 1464, 304, 10222, 8, 578, 893, 11, 889, 706, 539, 1027, 11054, 11, 374, 42386, 304, 8952, 449, 2324, 62999, 15319, 11, 323, 1436, 3663, 264, 78043, 6900, 3131, 704, 11, 4184, 311, 468, 16155, 49, 13, 2052, 648, 11, 889, 574, 16572, 555, 1077, 10177, 389, 1148, 311, 656, 2391, 420, 955, 315, 10672, 11, 1071, 279, 893, 3940, 87211, 389, 1077, 6134, 323, 76851, 449, 279, 6134, 59672, 1418, 35101, 2574, 439, 568, 6818, 311, 636, 304, 13, 3005, 1071, 25, 4194, 6, 1548, 574, 35101, 1093, 11, 364, 10267, 757, 304, 8945, 11, 584, 527, 17339, 1095, 757, 304, 11, 814, 527, 704, 311, 5622, 757, 2965, 358, 7111, 1555, 279, 1069, 24453, 1286, 323, 358, 3287, 956, 15641, 889, 433, 574, 11, 779, 358, 326, 35344, 279, 1948, 5409, 11, 10837, 311, 279, 1203, 11, 2663, 220, 17000, 323, 2751, 856, 6166, 3238, 6104, 1364, 4024, 311, 264, 1203, 3130, 311, 17622, 1077, 6166, 11, 1364, 6755, 264, 10121, 439, 279, 893, 14760, 1139, 279, 1514, 3039, 11, 459, 3158, 1405, 1077, 1716, 574, 1193, 220, 966, 4520, 1603, 279, 10672, 13, 3005, 1047, 1193, 6051, 2231, 1077, 1716, 311, 4950, 13, 364, 8100, 1436, 617, 1027, 304, 1618, 5737, 323, 568, 1436, 617, 77490, 304, 323, 11299, 389, 1077, 477, 4205, 2965, 1364, 1071, 13, 364, 2460, 358, 7020, 374, 358, 4934, 311, 3009, 1461, 505, 48389, 757, 477, 48389, 856, 10003, 3238, 2052, 648, 11, 889, 574, 16572, 555, 1077, 10177, 389, 1148, 311, 656, 2391, 420, 955, 315, 10672, 11, 1071, 279, 893, 3940, 87211, 389, 1077, 6134, 323, 76851, 449, 279, 6134, 59672, 1418, 35101, 2574, 439, 568, 6818, 311, 636, 304, 320, 49532, 279, 3321, 430, 279, 893, 14760, 1555, 8, 2052, 648, 1071, 1418, 1364, 4024, 311, 17622, 1077, 6166, 11, 1364, 6755, 264, 10121, 439, 279, 893, 14760, 1139, 279, 1514, 3039, 11, 459, 3158, 1405, 1077, 1716, 574, 1193, 220, 966, 4520, 1603, 279, 10672, 320, 49532, 279, 1514, 3039, 1405, 279, 10805, 33719, 10862, 8, 2052, 648, 1071, 279, 893, 574, 87657, 4194, 618, 7167, 11, 439, 422, 568, 574, 1234, 279, 10383, 315, 11217, 11, 323, 574, 5108, 520, 1077, 11, 902, 374, 994, 1364, 14219, 279, 6166, 11157, 13, 578, 893, 574, 4295, 304, 813, 98875, 323, 264, 2132, 17889, 4024, 1555, 813, 1450, 323, 1139, 813, 23152, 13, 578, 6691, 1071, 1364, 8774, 279, 6166, 8521, 389, 279, 10805, 33719, 439, 1364, 30315, 369, 30438, 9808, 311, 17782, 11, 4184, 311, 13585, 323, 23323, 13, 11995, 2052, 648, 323, 1077, 10003, 1051, 6220, 2768, 279, 10672, 11, 719, 2052, 648, 1071, 1364, 374, 6380, 14392, 433, 574, 539, 1077, 477, 1077, 10003, 430, 574, 2163, 304, 279, 8952, 13, 364, 2181, 574, 3060, 1461, 477, 757, 2965, 1071, 2052, 648, 13, 364, 40, 617, 856, 10003, 311, 6144, 22438, 19791, 25], prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

Please output the summary only, without any other text.\n\nArticle:\nChloe Sevigny has posed with just a lobster covering her modesty. Save her fashion jacket and mirror sandals, the 40-year-old can be seen on the cover of the Marfa Journal stark naked and sprawling out over a retro kitchen work top. The actress, who is considered an influencer within many fashion circles, makes a series of bizarre statements from a nun in chain underwear to scantily-clad Red Riding Hood as she creates four fake movie posters for the magazine. WARNING: EXPLICIT CONTENT. Claws for draws: Choe Sevigny ditches her underwear for new Marfa Journal pictures as she poses with a lobster over her crotch. The four fake billboards divide the whole magazine into four sections: raw, decadent, romantic and progressive. And they're sure to get attention, though loyal fans' interest in the content may be waning as the shoot sees the Swedish actress in a whole new light. Golden Globe winning and Academy Award nominated Chloe has previously enjoyed roles in\xa0Boys Don't Cry and\xa0American Psycho but these latest roles appear to put her in an all new-genre. In the most shocking image of the four book quarters, the beauty ditches her underwear in favour of the large marine crustacean. Stark naked: Besides a long fashion coat and a belt, Chloe was stark naked in the snaps. Provocative: Chloe posed on her knees wearing knickers and a chain between her legs. The fashionista was not without her accessories nonetheless and layered on some tribal beads between her bare chest and accentuated her enviable waist with a studded belt. She was seen sporting a subtle plaid coat, tying her tresses into a fuss-free low bun as she posed in a derelict kitchen setting. While it is not believed that the lobster is real,\xa0PETA's Managing Director Ingrid E. Newkirk told MailOnline: 'We're too kind to say what a pity it is that the lobster wasn't alive and wearing knuckledusters. 'So all we'll say is that we hope one day Chloë will realise how inferior she seems compared to a little animal who was killed just to cover a t**t. Fashionista: The fashion darling was still styled to perfection in Jean Paul Gaultier and Chanel Cruise. Daring: The actress appeared to poke fun at the movie industry with a series of mock film posters. Chloe, going virginal in white for a second picture, shows off her youthful frame in a second poster while dressed in a nun costume and headscarf. The title reads, 'Two Times A Virgin' and she sports lace knickers with a padlock and chain between her thighs to pose provocatively on her knees. Stylist Haley Wollens uses Chanel Cruise to dress the famous style star, as the cover caption indicates, with other credits including Proenza Schouler and Jean Paul Gaultier. Chloe, photographed by Brianna Capozzi, enjoys a throwback moment in velvet for one snap and adds a sexy edge to a red cape for another Running With Wolves mock up. Baring her rock hard stomach, the actress sums it up perfectly as she scrawls 'I put the HOT in PSYCHOTIC' across her abs while puffing on a cigarette. Youthful: The star looked sensational with her trim shape on show in a vintage costume. Fashion fan:\xa0Stylist Haley Wollens used Chanel Cruise to dress the famous style star with other credits including Proenza Schouler and Jean Paul Gaultier. Hot: The star summed it up perfectly with Hot In Psychotic written on her bare chest. Retro: The stylish star enjoyed a throwback moment in a velvet bra and trousers. Third issue: The Marfa Journal is a bi-annual European publication that\xa0combines of art and fashion. And the cheeky starlet certainly does look hot. Youthful beyond her 40 years, the fashion darling shoots a full view of her bare behind, on which a temporary cherry tattoo can be seen in another daring image. Chloe clashes her moods as she sports a sweet, white bonnet but pulls down her tights to reveal her derriere while leaning over a dirt bike. Bi-annual European publication, Marfa Journal, combines of art and fashion and is now in its third issue, edited by Alexandra Gordienko. Movies appear to be the hot topic for Chloe at the moment, after she publicly named and shamed her favourite (and detested) female movie stars this week. The blonde hit out at Academy Award winner Jennifer Lawrence in the spring issue of V magazine. She said: ‘I love when a movie star is a great movie star. I think Angelina is a great movie star. ‘I like Emma Stone. Whenever she’s herself, she’s really cute. Jennifer Lawrence I find annoying. Too crass.’ Cheeky: The model and actress bent over a dirt bike in her crystal whites, including a bonnet. Wild one: She didn't managed a smile but instead a moody stare while showing off her bare bottom. 'So much is about marketing and selling the product,' the star continued. And her latest photo shoot appears to be yet further poking fun at the movie industry. Moving away from Hollywood, Chloe's latest career move is her sixth collection in collaboration with Opening Ceremony. The Spring/Summer 2015 womenswear line is themed around preppy chic, inspired by the satirical ’80s cult film Heathers. Sassy: Chloe was modelling in a leotard and pointed boots with Hello Kitty designs. Retro: She enjoyed seventies styling in a patterned jumpsuit and long mermaidian locks. Magazine star: Four fake movie posters divide the whole magazine into four sections: Raw, Decadent, Romantic and Progressive.\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0,

Goals from David Silva and James Milner gave the hosts victory, in a match that contained several talking bouts. Nigel Pearson's side felt they should have been awarded two penalties during the match when Kramaric and team-mate Jeffrey Schlupp both fell under challenges during the clash at the Stadium. Leicester striker Andrej Kramaric is unsatisfied with the standard of Premier League refereeing against them. And Kramaric believes Wednesday night's match isn't the first time that Foxes have had the rub of the green go against them. 'We should have been awarded two penalties against Man City, one on me and one on [Jeffrey] Schlupp,' the 23-year-old told Goal in an exclusive. 'I admit, my contact with [Joe] Hart was not a penalty, but when Fernando fouled me, it was clearly inside the box. I have to admit: I am not satisfied [with] how referees treat Leicester.' Leicester were denied a penalty when Jeffrey Schlupp (left) fell under the challenge of Wilfried Bony. The Croatia international has scored twice in eight appearances for Leicester since joining the club in January from Rijeka. Despite their struggles as a team domestically, Kramaric feels he has adapted well to the demands of the Premier League - and in particular England's top-flight defender. 'I have played against many top Premier League defenders so far and I can handle every one, no one is impossible,' he added. 'I need just a little more time to get used to everything here.' Kramaric (right) believes he has adapted to Premier League defenders well since joining Leicester in January.\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=128, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=False, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: [128000, 9370, 5730, 553, 279, 2768, 3754, 4652, 304, 220, 4386, 11460, 13, 5321, 2612, 279, 12399, 1193, 11, 2085, 904, 1023, 1495, 382, 17064, 512, 2356, 51777, 45041, 27525, 73, 735, 2453, 277, 292, 706, 60479, 279, 5410, 315, 20210, 9130, 40008, 32875, 2768, 58849, 596, 220, 17, 12, 15, 5209, 10476, 18506, 520, 19922, 4409, 13, 55293, 505, 6941, 42141, 323, 7957, 10357, 1215, 6688, 279, 18939, 12845, 11, 304, 264, 2489, 430, 13282, 3892, 7556, 96271, 13, 66916, 59642, 596, 3185, 6612, 814, 1288, 617, 1027, 22034, 1403, 31086, 2391, 279, 2489, 994, 735, 2453, 277, 292, 323, 2128, 1474, 349, 42107, 50379, 32932, 2225, 11299, 1234, 11774, 2391, 279, 41003, 520, 279, 23462, 13, 58849, 45041, 27525, 73, 735, 2453, 277, 292, 374, 7120, 47365, 449, 279, 5410, 315, 20210, 9130, 40008, 32875, 2403, 1124, 13, 1628, 735, 2453, 277, 292, 13919, 8079, 3814, 596, 2489, 4536, 956, 279, 1176, 892, 430, 13585, 288, 617, 1047, 279, 10485, 315, 279, 6307, 733, 2403, 1124, 13, 364, 1687, 1288, 617, 1027, 22034, 1403, 31086, 2403, 2418, 4409, 11, 832, 389, 757, 323, 832, 389, 510, 39727, 8233, 60, 50379, 32932, 2965, 279, 220, 1419, 4771, 6418, 3309, 41047, 304, 459, 14079, 13, 364, 40, 17113, 11, 856, 3729, 449, 510, 41444, 60, 23750, 574, 539, 264, 16750, 11, 719, 994, 51485, 57625, 839, 757, 11, 433, 574, 9539, 4871, 279, 3830, 13, 358, 617, 311, 17113, 25, 358, 1097, 539, 20097, 510, 4291, 60, 1268, 96926, 4322, 58849, 3238, 58849, 1051, 15164, 264, 16750, 994, 42107, 50379, 32932, 320, 2414, 8, 11299, 1234, 279, 8815, 315, 10785, 98625, 426, 3633, 13, 578, 58311, 6625, 706, 16957, 11157, 304, 8223, 27351, 369, 58849, 2533, 18667, 279, 6469, 304, 6186, 505, 432, 3251, 53413, 13, 18185, 872, 28970, 439, 264, 2128, 98890, 11, 735, 2453, 277, 292, 11321, 568, 706, 30464, 1664, 311, 279, 18651, 315, 279, 20210, 9130, 482, 323, 304, 4040, 9635, 596, 1948, 77303, 29315, 13, 364, 40, 617, 6476, 2403, 1690, 1948, 20210, 9130, 41131, 779, 3117, 323, 358, 649, 3790, 1475, 832, 11, 912, 832, 374, 12266, 2965, 568, 3779, 13, 364, 40, 1205, 1120, 264, 2697, 810, 892, 311, 636, 1511, 311, 4395, 1618, 3238, 735, 2453, 277, 292, 320, 1315, 8, 13919, 568, 706, 30464, 311, 20210, 9130, 41131, 1664, 2533, 18667, 58849, 304, 6186, 382, 19791, 25], prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

Police say 31-year-old Trista Zickefoose shot her 40-year-old husband, Greg, on Sunday night at their duplex apartment in Knox Township, about 80 miles northeast of Pittsburgh. Authorities say that the couple had argued after smoking the drug together and that Trista Zickefoose later heard a noise that she believed was from an intruder. Scroll down for video. Incident: Police say 31-year-old Trista Zickefoose shot her 40-year-old husband, Greg, on Sunday night. Incident: The shooting reportedly took place at the couple's duplex apartment in Knox Township. Police say she grabbed a 9mm pistol she kept under her pillow and fired a warning shot. Police say her husband tried to take the gun away from her, but she shot him in the chest. She remains jailed Tuesday on a charge of criminal homicide. Court records don't list an attorney for her. Neighbor Ray Chappel told WJAC 'Well, I was awake last night and I heard a sound, I didn’t know if it was a gunshot or what. I wasn't expecting it. They seem to be nice people. She was nice. She used to walk her little girl down the street all the time.' Another neighbor, Regina Sarvey, told WTAJ 'What woke me up was the flash of the cameras it was so bright and they were taking pictures over at this neighbor's yard. I've seen them walking their dog and I've seen their little kids. Nathan Britton, who also lives in the community, told the television station 'I saw some flashing lights and what not out back here and I was looking around and saw they were across the street and there was fire trucks and an ambulance.' Crime: Police say Zickefoose's husband tried to take the gun away from her, but she shot him in the chest. She remains jailed Tuesday on a charge of criminal homicide.\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=128, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=False, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: [128000, 9370, 5730, 553, 279, 2768, 3754, 4652, 304, 220, 4386, 11460, 13, 5321, 2612, 279, 12399, 1193, 11, 2085, 904, 1023, 1495, 382, 17064, 512, 22993, 2019, 264, 20355, 5333, 1579, 505, 20149, 21747, 85890, 706, 72461, 6689, 1077, 10177, 1306, 8770, 1802, 1461, 369, 459, 10805, 33719, 13, 10289, 2019, 220, 2148, 4771, 6418, 1183, 9265, 1901, 292, 441, 831, 974, 6689, 1077, 220, 1272, 4771, 6418, 10177, 11, 16431, 11, 389, 7418, 3814, 520, 872, 81268, 13455, 304, 54450, 53767, 11, 922, 220, 1490, 8931, 41929, 315, 28627, 13, 68415, 2019, 430, 279, 5743, 1047, 18784, 1306, 20149, 279, 5623, 3871, 323, 430, 1183, 9265, 1901, 292, 441, 831, 974, 3010, 6755, 264, 12248, 430, 1364, 11846, 574, 505, 459, 10805, 33719, 13, 23198, 1523, 369, 2835, 13, 69835, 25, 10289, 2019, 220, 2148, 4771, 6418, 1183, 9265, 1901, 292, 441, 831, 974, 6689, 1077, 220, 1272, 4771, 6418, 10177, 11, 16431, 11, 389, 7418, 3814, 13, 69835, 25, 578, 10658, 18307, 3952, 2035, 520, 279, 5743, 596, 81268, 13455, 304, 54450, 53767, 13, 10289, 2019, 1364, 30418, 264, 220, 24, 3906, 40536, 1364, 8774, 1234, 1077, 43425, 323, 14219, 264, 10163, 6689, 13, 10289, 2019, 1077, 10177, 6818, 311, 1935, 279, 6166, 3201, 505, 1077, 11, 719, 1364, 6689, 1461, 304, 279, 15489, 13, 3005, 8625, 55606, 7742, 389, 264, 6900, 315, 9337, 50077, 13, 7301, 7576, 1541, 956, 1160, 459, 14065, 369, 1077, 13, 98263, 13558, 921, 680, 301, 3309, 468, 41, 1741, 364, 11649, 11, 358, 574, 35447, 1566, 3814, 323, 358, 6755, 264, 5222, 11, 358, 3287, 1431, 1440, 422, 433, 574, 264, 74881, 477, 1148, 13, 358, 5828, 956, 23132, 433, 13, 2435, 2873, 311, 387, 6555, 1274, 13, 3005, 574, 6555, 13, 3005, 1511, 311, 4321, 1077, 2697, 3828, 1523, 279, 8761, 682, 279, 892, 3238, 13596, 9760, 11, 70780, 13951, 5735, 11, 3309, 468, 15559, 41, 364, 3923, 39826, 757, 709, 574, 279, 8381, 315, 279, 18632, 433, 574, 779, 10107, 323, 814, 1051, 4737, 9364, 927, 520, 420, 9760, 596, 20085, 13, 358, 3077, 3970, 1124, 11689, 872, 5679, 323, 358, 3077, 3970, 872, 2697, 6980, 13, 37837, 5567, 783, 11, 889, 1101, 6439, 304, 279, 4029, 11, 3309, 279, 12707, 8216, 364, 40, 5602, 1063, 50857, 13001, 323, 1148, 539, 704, 1203, 1618, 323, 358, 574, 3411, 2212, 323, 5602, 814, 1051, 4028, 279, 8761, 323, 1070, 574, 4027, 27861, 323, 459, 51632, 3238, 24845, 25, 10289, 2019, 1901, 292, 441, 831, 974, 596, 10177, 6818, 311, 1935, 279, 6166, 3201, 505, 1077, 11, 719, 1364, 6689, 1461, 304, 279, 15489, 13, 3005, 8625, 55606, 7742, 389, 264, 6900, 315, 9337, 50077, 382, 19791, 25], prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

Aaron Bridgeman smashed into his step-sister Vicky, 40, after she was thrown off a motorbike she was riding and landed in the path of his car. Bridgeman, 35, who does not have a driving licence, could not stop his Peugeot in time and ran his step-sister over before she was hit by another car. Aaron Bridgeman (left) was jailed for seven years for accidentally killing his step-sister Vicky (right) during an illegal road race. Biker Jason Szalkowski, who also does not have a licence, was thrown from the motorcycle and left with brain damage after hitting floodwater on the lane near Caerphilly, south Wales. Bridgeman then fled the scene because he did not want to be caught driving a borrowed car without insurance. He pleaded guilty to driving without a licence and insurance, to fleeing the scene of a crime and of failing to report an accident. Bridgeman, from Caerphilly, was today jailed for seven years and banned from driving for six years. Bridgeman, from Caerphilly, was today jailed for seven years and banned from driving for six years. Sentencing him at Newport Crown Court, judge Daniel Willliams said: 'You never passed a driving test but that did not stop you from driving almost every day. 'You thought that the rules of the road did not apply to you. Your driving was terribly dangerous. 'Driving conditions that day were terribly hazardous but you knew that would make the race even better and you used that narrow lane as a race track. 'You were driving at a grossly excessive speed, driving the car at its limit to keep up with the motorbike. 'You drove into your sister - driving so close to the bike it could not be avoided. 'You took a cursory look at your sister and Mr Szalkowski and calmy drove off.' At a previous hearing, the court heard that Bridgeman was 'right behind' the motorcycle when his step-sister fell into the road. Prosecutor Ieuan Bennett said: 'Bridgeman simply wasn't able to avoid his own step-sister as she went over the front of his car.' Bridgeman briefly stopped his car before fleeing the scene of the accident in December 2013, the court was told. Ms Bridgeman was riding on the back of Jason Szalkowski's (pictured) motorbike when it hit a puddle, flinging her off the bike and into the road. Mr Bennett added: 'He looked briefly at Jason Szalkowski, who he knew well, and at the body of his own step-sister. 'He then got promptly back into his car and drove off.' Ms Bridgeman was run over by another car as she lay in the road. The driver thought he had hit a sheep because of her white jumper. Mr Bennett said it was 'impossible' to say which impact killed Ms Bridgeman - also known as Claire - but that she died as a result of the race. Mr Szalkowski could have faced prosecution but it was decided it was 'not in the public interest' because he was so seriously injured.\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=128, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=False, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: [128000, 9370, 5730, 553, 279, 2768, 3754, 4652, 304, 220, 4386, 11460, 13, 5321, 2612, 279, 12399, 1193, 11, 2085, 904, 1023, 1495, 382, 17064, 512, 32, 5696, 889, 33484, 7577, 813, 1866, 3094, 1355, 1601, 2391, 459, 12079, 5754, 7102, 706, 1027, 55606, 369, 8254, 1667, 13, 26757, 32437, 70, 16357, 57520, 1139, 813, 3094, 1355, 1601, 650, 19501, 11, 220, 1272, 11, 1306, 1364, 574, 15338, 1022, 264, 9048, 56255, 1364, 574, 20427, 323, 27212, 304, 279, 1853, 315, 813, 1841, 13, 32437, 70, 16357, 11, 220, 1758, 11, 889, 1587, 539, 617, 264, 10043, 31073, 11, 1436, 539, 3009, 813, 5250, 94522, 304, 892, 323, 10837, 813, 3094, 1355, 1601, 927, 1603, 1364, 574, 4295, 555, 2500, 1841, 13, 26757, 32437, 70, 16357, 320, 2414, 8, 574, 55606, 369, 8254, 1667, 369, 33484, 13419, 813, 3094, 1355, 1601, 650, 19501, 320, 1315, 8, 2391, 459, 12079, 5754, 7102, 13, 426, 25840, 18984, 45290, 1727, 29384, 11, 889, 1101, 1587, 539, 617, 264, 31073, 11, 574, 15338, 505, 279, 35404, 323, 2163, 449, 8271, 5674, 1306, 20129, 18197, 13284, 389, 279, 21971, 3221, 14751, 261, 764, 14722, 11, 10007, 23782, 13, 32437, 70, 16357, 1243, 30010, 279, 6237, 1606, 568, 1550, 539, 1390, 311, 387, 10791, 10043, 264, 46664, 1841, 2085, 8276, 13, 1283, 40001, 16390, 311, 10043, 2085, 264, 31073, 323, 8276, 11, 311, 50387, 279, 6237, 315, 264, 9977, 323, 315, 22109, 311, 1934, 459, 11677, 13, 32437, 70, 16357, 11, 505, 14751, 261, 764, 14722, 11, 574, 3432, 55606, 369, 8254, 1667, 323, 21501, 505, 10043, 369, 4848, 1667, 13, 32437, 70, 16357, 11, 505, 14751, 261, 764, 14722, 11, 574, 3432, 55606, 369, 8254, 1667, 323, 21501, 505, 10043, 369, 4848, 1667, 13, 24248, 11627, 1461, 520, 59900, 29743, 7301, 11, 11913, 15469, 4946, 747, 4214, 1071, 25, 364, 2675, 2646, 5946, 264, 10043, 1296, 719, 430, 1550, 539, 3009, 499, 505, 10043, 4661, 1475, 1938, 13, 364, 2675, 3463, 430, 279, 5718, 315, 279, 5754, 1550, 539, 3881, 311, 499, 13, 4718, 10043, 574, 50136, 11660, 13, 364, 94936, 4787, 430, 1938, 1051, 50136, 51024, 719, 499, 7020, 430, 1053, 1304, 279, 7102, 1524, 2731, 323, 499, 1511, 430, 15376, 21971, 439, 264, 7102, 3839, 13, 364, 2675, 1051, 10043, 520, 264, 20547, 398, 27639, 4732, 11, 10043, 279, 1841, 520, 1202, 4017, 311, 2567, 709, 449, 279, 9048, 56255, 13, 364, 2675, 23980, 1139, 701, 13219, 482, 10043, 779, 3345, 311, 279, 13260, 433, 1436, 539, 387, 31890, 13, 364, 2675, 3952, 264, 24018, 683, 1427, 520, 701, 13219, 323, 4491, 45290, 1727, 29384, 323, 1652, 2465, 23980, 1022, 3238, 2468, 264, 3766, 11011, 11, 279, 5590, 6755, 430, 32437, 70, 16357, 574, 364, 1315, 4920, 6, 279, 35404, 994, 813, 3094, 1355, 1601, 11299, 1139, 279, 5754, 13, 88428, 358, 68, 10602, 39386, 1071, 25, 364, 33, 1907, 70, 16357, 5042, 5828, 956, 3025, 311, 5766, 813, 1866, 3094, 1355, 1601, 439, 1364, 4024, 927, 279, 4156, 315, 813, 1841, 3238, 32437, 70, 16357, 27851, 10717, 813, 1841, 1603, 50387, 279, 6237, 315, 279, 11677, 304, 6790, 220, 679, 18, 11, 279, 5590, 574, 3309, 13, 16450, 32437, 70, 16357, 574, 20427, 389, 279, 1203, 315, 18984, 45290, 1727, 29384, 596, 320, 69389, 8, 9048, 56255, 994, 433, 4295, 264, 55682, 273, 11, 1344, 24992, 1077, 1022, 279, 13260, 323, 1139, 279, 5754, 13, 4491, 39386, 3779, 25, 364, 1548, 7111, 27851, 520, 18984, 45290, 1727, 29384, 11, 889, 568, 7020, 1664, 11, 323, 520, 279, 2547, 315, 813, 1866, 3094, 1355, 1601, 13, 364, 1548, 1243, 2751, 40522, 1203, 1139, 813, 1841, 323, 23980, 1022, 3238, 16450, 32437, 70, 16357, 574, 1629, 927, 555, 2500, 1841, 439, 1364, 11203, 304, 279, 5754, 13, 578, 5696, 3463, 568, 1047, 4295, 264, 33012, 1606, 315, 1077, 4251, 70084, 13, 4491, 39386, 1071, 433, 574, 364, 318, 10236, 6, 311, 2019, 902, 5536, 7577, 16450, 32437, 70, 16357, 482, 1101, 3967, 439, 43675, 482, 719, 430, 1364, 8636, 439, 264, 1121, 315, 279, 7102, 13, 4491, 45290, 1727, 29384, 1436, 617, 17011, 32699, 719, 433, 574, 6773, 433, 574, 364, 1962, 304, 279, 586, 2802, 6, 1606, 568, 574, 779, 14243, 15902, 382, 19791, 25], prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

Senior sources within St James’ Park are convinced that the former England manager will be their next head coach come the summer and say the £3.5m pocketed from Alan Pardew’s defection to Crystal Palace in January will cover the cost of his arrival. It is McClaren’s relationship with United’s chief scout Graham Carr – in essence, the club’s director of football – which is the driving force behind their move for the 53-year-old. Newcastle United are willing to pay the £2million compensation fee for Derby County boss Steve McClaren. Head coach John Carver looks set to be replaced come the end of the Premier League season. Carr has been tasked with finding the new boss should the Magpies decide to replace current head coach John Carver - and that is looking increasingly likely. Sources at Newcastle have indicated McClaren is the only name being considered and they feel there is a willingness on his part to swap Pride Park for St James’ Park. McClaren’s camp deny this, instead insisting he is fully focussed on winning promotion to the Premier League with Derby. Derby boss McClaren has a good relationship with United’s chief scout Graham Carr (pictured) Despite a strong campaign, Derby are in danger of missing out on automatic promotion to the top flight. That, however, is to be expected given his promise to the club’s hierarchy that he would see out the season with the Rams when he was first linked with Newcastle in January. McClaren signed a new three-year deal in August and chief executive Sam Rush has again insisted this week that their manager is going nowhere. However, Derby are in danger of missing out on automatic promotion to the top flight and there is even a chance they could slip out of the play-off places. They announced losses of £7m this week, compared to the £18.7m profit recorded by Newcastle, who intend to invest heavily in their playing squad this summer. It is thought all of those factors will be enough for Carr to persuade McClaren to head to the North-East ahead of next season.\n\nSummary:', params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=128, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=False, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: [128000, 9370, 5730, 553, 279, 2768, 3754, 4652, 304, 220, 4386, 11460, 13, 5321, 2612, 279, 12399, 1193, 11, 2085, 904, 1023, 1495, 382, 17064, 512, 3648, 36208, 3723, 527, 10032, 311, 2343, 279, 7083, 17, 59413, 20448, 11307, 369, 46873, 6406, 13697, 14129, 60740, 9329, 11, 13482, 3796, 31869, 13, 19903, 8336, 2949, 800, 7957, 529, 5657, 527, 22954, 430, 279, 4846, 9635, 6783, 690, 387, 872, 1828, 2010, 7395, 2586, 279, 7474, 323, 2019, 279, 7083, 18, 13, 20, 76, 18301, 291, 505, 26349, 393, 569, 365, 753, 11211, 407, 311, 29016, 31396, 304, 6186, 690, 3504, 279, 2853, 315, 813, 19163, 13, 1102, 374, 60740, 9329, 753, 5133, 449, 3723, 753, 10388, 54594, 26181, 30474, 1389, 304, 28591, 11, 279, 6469, 753, 7690, 315, 9141, 1389, 902, 374, 279, 10043, 5457, 4920, 872, 3351, 369, 279, 220, 4331, 4771, 6418, 13, 44226, 3723, 527, 10032, 311, 2343, 279, 7083, 17, 59413, 20448, 11307, 369, 46873, 6406, 13697, 14129, 60740, 9329, 13, 11452, 7395, 3842, 3341, 424, 5992, 743, 311, 387, 12860, 2586, 279, 842, 315, 279, 20210, 9130, 3280, 13, 30474, 706, 1027, 51920, 449, 9455, 279, 502, 13697, 1288, 279, 7023, 45752, 10491, 311, 8454, 1510, 2010, 7395, 3842, 3341, 424, 482, 323, 430, 374, 3411, 15098, 4461, 13, 48132, 520, 44226, 617, 16717, 60740, 9329, 374, 279, 1193, 836, 1694, 6646, 323, 814, 2733, 1070, 374, 264, 39375, 389, 813, 961, 311, 14626, 43246, 5657, 369, 800, 7957, 529, 5657, 13, 60740, 9329, 753, 3190, 23973, 420, 11, 4619, 60727, 568, 374, 7373, 8413, 59942, 389, 11230, 20862, 311, 279, 20210, 9130, 449, 46873, 13, 46873, 13697, 60740, 9329, 706, 264, 1695, 5133, 449, 3723, 753, 10388, 54594, 26181, 30474, 320, 69389, 8, 18185, 264, 3831, 4901, 11, 46873, 527, 304, 8137, 315, 7554, 704, 389, 17392, 20862, 311, 279, 1948, 11213, 13, 3011, 11, 4869, 11, 374, 311, 387, 3685, 2728, 813, 11471, 311, 279, 6469, 753, 30022, 430, 568, 1053, 1518, 704, 279, 3280, 449, 279, 38603, 994, 568, 574, 1176, 10815, 449, 44226, 304, 6186, 13, 60740, 9329, 8667, 264, 502, 2380, 4771, 3568, 304, 6287, 323, 10388, 11145, 8388, 35175, 706, 1578, 29676, 420, 2046, 430, 872, 6783, 374, 2133, 28211, 13, 4452, 11, 46873, 527, 304, 8137, 315, 7554, 704, 389, 17392, 20862, 311, 279, 1948, 11213, 323, 1070, 374, 1524, 264, 6140, 814, 1436, 21818, 704, 315, 279, 1514, 12744, 7634, 13, 2435, 7376, 18151, 315, 7083, 22, 76, 420, 2046, 11, 7863, 311, 279, 7083, 972, 13, 22, 76, 11626, 12715, 555, 44226, 11, 889, 30730, 311, 2793, 17345, 304, 872, 5737, 19037, 420, 7474, 13, 1102, 374, 3463, 682, 315, 1884, 9547, 690, 387, 3403, 369, 30474, 311, 51041, 60740, 9329, 311, 2010, 311, 279, 4892, 94764, 8469, 315, 1828, 3280, 382, 19791, 25], prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

Scientists said that, in the average boy or girl with autism, genetics explain up to 98 per cent of the illness. The research, by King’s College London, found the condition is highly inheritable. Controversial research linking autism with the MMR jab has been widely discredited, but more recent concern has focused on the condition being fuelled by environmental factors such as pollution. The team compared the behaviour of pairs of identical twins, who share all their DNA, and non-identical twins, who have only half their genes in common (file picture) With cases of autism much more common today than in the past, many fear it is also being caused by modern lifestyles. Estimates suggest that as many as one in 100 people in the UK now has autism. But the researchers said their study suggested that lifestyle and environmental factors were a distant second to genetics. The team compared the behaviour of pairs of identical twins, who share all their DNA, and non-identical twins, who have only half their genes in common. They found the condition was far more common in identical twins than in non-identical ones. The study, in the journal JAMA Psychiatry, concluded that rogue DNA explains between 74 and 98 per cent of the cause of the average case of autism. If genes are key, the recent rise in cases could be explained by more people being correctly diagnosed with the condition. Controversial research which linked autism with the MMR jab has now been widely discredited (file picture) Dr Francesca Happe told the BBC: ‘Our findings suggest environmental factors are smaller, which is important because some parents are concerned whether things like high pollution might be causing autism. The main consensus now is that the rise in diagnosis has more to do with increased awareness of the condition.’ Dr Judith Brown, of the National Autistic Society, said: ‘Autism is a highly complex story of genes not only interacting with other genes, but with non-genetic factors too. ‘This large population-based twin sample is significant because it helps us to understand much more about the role genetics play in autism and opens up the possibility of whole families gaining a better understanding of a condition they may share.’ But she added: ‘We are still a long way from knowing what leads to autism. ‘What people with the condition, their families and carers need most of all is access now to the right kind of support to be able to lead full lives.’ The study looked at 128 pairs of twins in which at least one sibling had an autism diagnosis, between the ages of 12 and 14. Lead researcher Beata Tick said: ‘This study shows that the genes are very important and the increased rate of autism is more down to awareness than environmental factors.’ Latest figures suggest more than one in 100 people in Britain has autism, including related conditions such as Asperger’s syndrome. This is a ten-fold increase on 30 years ago. Symptoms vary, but usually revolve around difficulty with social interaction, communication problems and a need for a strict routine. Many patients are treated with speech and behavioural therapy. Although drugs can be prescribed to control symptoms such as aggression or hyperactivity, there is no cure.\n\nSummary:', params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=128, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=False, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: [128000, 9370, 5730, 553, 279, 2768, 3754, 4652, 304, 220, 4386, 11460, 13, 5321, 2612, 279, 12399, 1193, 11, 2085, 904, 1023, 1495, 382, 17064, 512, 20175, 2191, 374, 14918, 9057, 555, 264, 1716, 753, 21389, 11, 264, 3682, 4007, 315, 8013, 44736, 706, 1766, 13, 57116, 1071, 430, 11, 304, 279, 5578, 8334, 477, 3828, 449, 38281, 11, 56104, 10552, 709, 311, 220, 3264, 824, 2960, 315, 279, 17563, 13, 578, 3495, 11, 555, 6342, 753, 9304, 7295, 11, 1766, 279, 3044, 374, 7701, 24683, 481, 13, 2140, 12848, 532, 3495, 31799, 38281, 449, 279, 386, 18953, 61164, 706, 1027, 13882, 834, 67309, 11, 719, 810, 3293, 4747, 706, 10968, 389, 279, 3044, 1694, 10633, 839, 555, 12434, 9547, 1778, 439, 25793, 13, 578, 2128, 7863, 279, 17432, 315, 13840, 315, 20086, 44736, 11, 889, 4430, 682, 872, 15922, 11, 323, 2536, 12, 1748, 950, 44736, 11, 889, 617, 1193, 4376, 872, 21389, 304, 4279, 320, 1213, 6945, 8, 3161, 5157, 315, 38281, 1790, 810, 4279, 3432, 1109, 304, 279, 3347, 11, 1690, 8850, 433, 374, 1101, 1694, 9057, 555, 6617, 79731, 13, 95619, 4284, 430, 439, 1690, 439, 832, 304, 220, 1041, 1274, 304, 279, 6560, 1457, 706, 38281, 13, 2030, 279, 12074, 1071, 872, 4007, 12090, 430, 19433, 323, 12434, 9547, 1051, 264, 29827, 2132, 311, 56104, 13, 578, 2128, 7863, 279, 17432, 315, 13840, 315, 20086, 44736, 11, 889, 4430, 682, 872, 15922, 11, 323, 2536, 12, 1748, 950, 44736, 11, 889, 617, 1193, 4376, 872, 21389, 304, 4279, 13, 2435, 1766, 279, 3044, 574, 3117, 810, 4279, 304, 20086, 44736, 1109, 304, 2536, 12, 1748, 950, 6305, 13, 578, 4007, 11, 304, 279, 8486, 622, 39200, 69244, 11, 20536, 430, 54991, 15922, 15100, 1990, 220, 5728, 323, 220, 3264, 824, 2960, 315, 279, 5353, 315, 279, 5578, 1162, 315, 38281, 13, 1442, 21389, 527, 1401, 11, 279, 3293, 10205, 304, 5157, 1436, 387, 11497, 555, 810, 1274, 1694, 12722, 29704, 449, 279, 3044, 13, 2140, 12848, 532, 3495, 902, 10815, 38281, 449, 279, 386, 18953, 61164, 706, 1457, 1027, 13882, 834, 67309, 320, 1213, 6945, 8, 2999, 43833, 936, 473, 34531, 3309, 279, 18588, 25, 3451, 8140, 14955, 4284, 12434, 9547, 527, 9333, 11, 902, 374, 3062, 1606, 1063, 6699, 527, 11920, 3508, 2574, 1093, 1579, 25793, 2643, 387, 14718, 38281, 13, 578, 1925, 24811, 1457, 374, 430, 279, 10205, 304, 23842, 706, 810, 311, 656, 449, 7319, 17985, 315, 279, 3044, 14639, 2999, 79193, 10690, 11, 315, 279, 5165, 9648, 4633, 13581, 11, 1071, 25, 3451, 20175, 2191, 374, 264, 7701, 6485, 3446, 315, 21389, 539, 1193, 45830, 449, 1023, 21389, 11, 719, 449, 2536, 37564, 5411, 9547, 2288, 13, 3451, 2028, 3544, 7187, 6108, 28497, 6205, 374, 5199, 1606, 433, 8779, 603, 311, 3619, 1790, 810, 922, 279, 3560, 56104, 1514, 304, 38281, 323, 16264, 709, 279, 13336, 315, 4459, 8689, 30240, 264, 2731, 8830, 315, 264, 3044, 814, 1253, 4430, 14639, 2030, 1364, 3779, 25, 3451, 1687, 527, 2103, 264, 1317, 1648, 505, 14392, 1148, 11767, 311, 38281, 13, 3451, 3923, 1274, 449, 279, 3044, 11, 872, 8689, 323, 1841, 388, 1205, 1455, 315, 682, 374, 2680, 1457, 311, 279, 1314, 3169, 315, 1862, 311, 387, 3025, 311, 3063, 2539, 6439, 14639, 578, 4007, 7111, 520, 220, 4386, 13840, 315, 44736, 304, 902, 520, 3325, 832, 45323, 1047, 459, 38281, 23842, 11, 1990, 279, 17051, 315, 220, 717, 323, 220, 975, 13, 30982, 32185, 2893, 460, 54192, 1071, 25, 3451, 2028, 4007, 5039, 430, 279, 21389, 527, 1633, 3062, 323, 279, 7319, 4478, 315, 38281, 374, 810, 1523, 311, 17985, 1109, 12434, 9547, 14639, 29257, 12678, 4284, 810, 1109, 832, 304, 220, 1041, 1274, 304, 13527, 706, 38281, 11, 2737, 5552, 4787, 1778, 439, 1666, 716, 1414, 753, 28439, 13, 1115, 374, 264, 5899, 24325, 5376, 389, 220, 966, 1667, 4227, 13, 77417, 13592, 11, 719, 6118, 5891, 4035, 2212, 17250, 449, 3674, 16628, 11, 10758, 5435, 323, 264, 1205, 369, 264, 7452, 14348, 13, 9176, 6978, 527, 12020, 449, 8982, 323, 88979, 15419, 13, 10541, 11217, 649, 387, 32031, 311, 2585, 13803, 1778, 439, 40307, 477, 17508, 7323, 11, 1070, 374, 912, 27208, 382, 19791, 25], prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

Please output the summary only, without any other text.\n\nArticle:\nSusan Lenihan, 30, (pictured leaving court last week) admitted harassment after she 'terrorised' her neighbours for two years. A mother who threw eggs at neighbours and poured washing-up liquid over their car is facing prison sentence. Susan Lenihan, 30, spent two years 'persistently targeting' residents in the cul-de-sac they shared in Birmingham, West Midlands, after claims they told police about another neighbour having drugs. James Harrison and his wife Dominique Wilcox-Harrison said their family had been 'victimised' after Lenihan put up posters in her windows calling them a 'grass'. Birmingham Magistrates' Court heard the mother-of-one had also shouted at the couple, warning them to 'watch your family' and threw eggs at him while he visited a disabled neighbour. Lenihan admitted a charge of harassment and her sentencing was adjourned until April 2, where District Judge Jan Jellema told her that all options were open, including imprisonment. David Palmer, prosecuting, said the abuse began after another resident's home was searched by police looking for drugs. Mr Palmer said: 'The defendant put up posters in her windows calling Mr\xa0Harrison and his wife a 'grass'. The posters also included the words 'act now'.' The court heard Mr Harrison was later prosecuted for dangerous driving but it was thrown out because Lenihan was not considered a credible witness. He also reported several incidents of damage to his car and on February 13 last year Lenhihan was seen spitting on his car after Mr Harrison fitted CCTV outside his home. Mr Palmer said an attempt at mediation between the two parties had failed and Lenihan threw eggs at Mr Harrison when he visited a disabled neighbour. 'The defendant opened a bedroom window and threw eggs in\xa0his direction,' he said. 'They landed on the ground next to him. It appears some of the yoke went on his shoes.' There was another incident in July when Mr Harrison found what was believed to be washing-up liquid on his car. He later checked the CCTV and saw the defendant spraying the car. The cul-de-sac in Shard End, Birmingham, where Lenihan lived near to James Harrison and his wife Dominique Wilcox-Harrison. Christopher Stewart, defending, said it was not just a 'one-sided campaign of terror'. Speaking after Lenihan pleaded guilty, Mr Harrison said his family had been victimised because 'we are as straight as it comes'. 'If we have a problem we talk to the person we have the problem with. 'These people don't like people who stand up to them so victimise and bully them with others in the hope we move and bow down. The court heard that Lenihan had accused the Harrison family of 'grassing' up another neighbour to police about possessing drugs. She put up posters in her windows saying they were 'grasses' and to 'act now' 'Why should the victims move when it's the bullies that should be moved and lose what they had – which in this case was a nice grove and nice neighbours.' He added that there were times when the families enjoyed summer evenings together, chatting and having a laugh. Mr Harrison also said he had never considered moving away and is hopeful that after her sentence is handed out she is moved out of the area.\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=128, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=False, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: [128000, 9370, 5730, 553, 279, 2768, 3754, 4652, 304, 220, 4386, 11460, 13, 5321, 2612, 279, 12399, 1193, 11, 2085, 904, 1023, 1495, 382, 17064, 512, 86383, 25234, 57988, 11, 220, 966, 11, 320, 69389, 9564, 5590, 1566, 2046, 8, 16584, 26425, 1306, 1364, 364, 38488, 4147, 6, 1077, 36956, 369, 1403, 1667, 13, 362, 6691, 889, 22982, 19335, 520, 36956, 323, 44033, 28786, 5352, 14812, 927, 872, 1841, 374, 13176, 9527, 11914, 13, 31033, 25234, 57988, 11, 220, 966, 11, 7543, 1403, 1667, 364, 40926, 4501, 25103, 6, 11062, 304, 279, 11957, 6953, 1355, 582, 814, 6222, 304, 36937, 11, 4410, 81251, 11, 1306, 8349, 814, 3309, 4379, 922, 2500, 22686, 3515, 11217, 13, 7957, 36627, 323, 813, 7555, 23286, 2428, 10785, 83100, 11529, 51103, 1071, 872, 3070, 1047, 1027, 364, 92039, 4147, 6, 1306, 25234, 57988, 2231, 709, 39568, 304, 1077, 11276, 8260, 1124, 264, 364, 54454, 4527, 36937, 7023, 94200, 6, 7301, 6755, 279, 6691, 8838, 19101, 1047, 1101, 44543, 520, 279, 5743, 11, 10163, 1124, 311, 364, 14658, 701, 3070, 6, 323, 22982, 19335, 520, 1461, 1418, 568, 12263, 264, 8552, 22686, 13, 25234, 57988, 16584, 264, 6900, 315, 26425, 323, 1077, 51617, 574, 12751, 3514, 291, 3156, 5936, 220, 17, 11, 1405, 11182, 20819, 4448, 622, 6853, 1764, 3309, 1077, 430, 682, 2671, 1051, 1825, 11, 2737, 43374, 13, 6941, 42216, 11, 98274, 11, 1071, 279, 11737, 6137, 1306, 2500, 19504, 596, 2162, 574, 27600, 555, 4379, 3411, 369, 11217, 13, 4491, 42216, 1071, 25, 364, 791, 26884, 2231, 709, 39568, 304, 1077, 11276, 8260, 4491, 119493, 51103, 323, 813, 7555, 264, 364, 54454, 4527, 578, 39568, 1101, 5343, 279, 4339, 364, 533, 1457, 6, 3238, 578, 5590, 6755, 4491, 36627, 574, 3010, 58559, 369, 11660, 10043, 719, 433, 574, 15338, 704, 1606, 25234, 57988, 574, 539, 6646, 264, 43010, 11550, 13, 1283, 1101, 5068, 3892, 24455, 315, 5674, 311, 813, 1841, 323, 389, 7552, 220, 1032, 1566, 1060, 25234, 6151, 10118, 574, 3970, 993, 15154, 389, 813, 1841, 1306, 4491, 36627, 29441, 71338, 4994, 813, 2162, 13, 4491, 42216, 1071, 459, 4879, 520, 77673, 1990, 279, 1403, 9875, 1047, 4745, 323, 25234, 57988, 22982, 19335, 520, 4491, 36627, 994, 568, 12263, 264, 8552, 22686, 13, 364, 791, 26884, 9107, 264, 14150, 3321, 323, 22982, 19335, 304, 4194, 26301, 5216, 2965, 568, 1071, 13, 364, 7009, 27212, 389, 279, 5015, 1828, 311, 1461, 13, 1102, 8111, 1063, 315, 279, 379, 4845, 4024, 389, 813, 15653, 3238, 2684, 574, 2500, 10672, 304, 5887, 994, 4491, 36627, 1766, 1148, 574, 11846, 311, 387, 28786, 5352, 14812, 389, 813, 1841, 13, 1283, 3010, 10273, 279, 71338, 323, 5602, 279, 26884, 83636, 279, 1841, 13, 578, 11957, 6953, 1355, 582, 304, 96466, 4060, 11, 36937, 11, 1405, 25234, 57988, 12439, 3221, 311, 7957, 36627, 323, 813, 7555, 23286, 2428, 10785, 83100, 11529, 51103, 13, 26035, 29868, 11, 29269, 11, 1071, 433, 574, 539, 1120, 264, 364, 606, 50858, 4901, 315, 8818, 4527, 45072, 1306, 25234, 57988, 40001, 16390, 11, 4491, 36627, 1071, 813, 3070, 1047, 1027, 11996, 4147, 1606, 364, 906, 527, 439, 7833, 439, 433, 4131, 4527, 364, 2746, 584, 617, 264, 3575, 584, 3137, 311, 279, 1732, 584, 617, 279, 3575, 449, 13, 364, 9673, 1274, 1541, 956, 1093, 1274, 889, 2559, 709, 311, 1124, 779, 11996, 1082, 323, 64176, 1124, 449, 3885, 304, 279, 3987, 584, 3351, 323, 15631, 1523, 13, 578, 5590, 6755, 430, 25234, 57988, 1047, 13487, 279, 36627, 3070, 315, 364, 54454, 287, 6, 709, 2500, 22686, 311, 4379, 922, 60662, 11217, 13, 3005, 2231, 709, 39568, 304, 1077, 11276, 5605, 814, 1051, 364, 911, 52090, 6, 323, 311, 364, 533, 1457, 6, 364, 10445, 1288, 279, 12697, 3351, 994, 433, 596, 279, 17231, 552, 430, 1288, 387, 7882, 323, 9229, 1148, 814, 1047, 1389, 902, 304, 420, 1162, 574, 264, 6555, 10707, 588, 323, 6555, 36956, 3238, 1283, 3779, 430, 1070, 1051, 3115, 994, 279, 8689, 14333, 7474, 59938, 3871, 11, 52067, 323, 3515, 264, 12835, 13, 4491, 36627, 1101, 1071, 568, 1047, 2646, 6646, 7366, 3201, 323, 374, 38650, 430, 1306, 1077, 11914, 374, 23415, 704, 1364, 374, 7882, 704, 315, 279, 3158, 382, 19791, 25], prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

Fellow secondary school pupils bullied Mohammed Emwazi - calling him ‘Little Mo’, it emerged yesterday. Emwazi - revealed last week as Jihadi John - was also said to have self-esteem problems and was even given anger management therapy at Quintin Kynaston school in north-west London. A former friend said a gang of older teenagers used to wait outside the school for Emwazi, then 14 and smaller and weaker than other boys his age. ‘They would steal his lunch money and push him around a bit,’ he said. ‘He was very quiet and a bit scrawny back then so we used to call him Little Mo.’ The St John’s Wood school is subject to a Department for Education investigation after it emerged that at least three past pupils have joined Islamist terror groups and contemporaries of Emwazi have claimed young Muslims were ‘groomed’ by radicals. Its former headmistress, Jo Shuter, said she recalled Emwazi was bullied when he was 14, but denied there had been a problem with radicalisation. She told the BBC yesterday: ‘He had some issues with being bullied, which we dealt with. Pushed around:\xa0A former friend said a gang of older teenagers used to wait outside Quintin Kynaston school (pictured) in north-west London for Emwazi, then 14 and smaller and weaker than other boys his age. ‘By the time he got into the sixth form he, to all intents and purposes, was a hard-working aspirational young man who went on to the university that he wanted. ‘There was never any sense that any of these young men as I knew them were radicalised when they were at school.’ One of Emwazi’s contemporaries at the school, Choukri Ellekhlifi, was killed in Syria after joining an Al Qaeda group and a third pupil, Mohammed Sakr, was killed in a US air strike on Al Shabaab fighters in Somalia. Emwazi’s younger brother Omar, 21, was known as a member of the ‘Muslim Mafia’ at Quintin Kynaston.

Students from Glenmore Park High School, in Penrith, NSW, became involved in a vicious fight erupting during the school day in which students were pushed to the ground and physically assaulted. The brawl allegedly started when two year nine students began arguing verbally and drew more students in when onlookers pushed those standing near the fight. Scroll down for video. Students from Glenmore Park High School, in Penrith, NSW, became involved in a vicious fight last Tuesday. Students from the school were pushed to the ground and physically assaulted. The brawl allegedly started when two year nine students began arguing verbally. 'All older boys were pushing all random girls into it and that’s how it got bigger and bigger,' a student from Glenmore Park High told 9news. The footage shows students screaming, punching one another and pulling hair. One girl is in the middle of the brawling group, and appears to fall to the ground under the attack. '[They were] punching her in the face and pulling her hair, there was so much screaming it was getting so wild,' another student told 9news. 'I couldn’t move I was getting pushed around because of how many people were in the fight.' While the argument originated between two junior students, senior students allegedly involved themselves, including students from year 11. The footage shows students screaming, punching one another and pulling hair. One girl is in the middle of the brawling group, and appears to fall to the ground under the attack. The footage shows a male yelling 'girls, get out of here' as the brawl continues to escalate. A teacher attempted to break up the brawl, and it is understood that police were called to attend the scene. First aid was administered to several students, but there were no serious injuries sustained by those involved. NSW Education Minister Adrian Picalee confirmed that five students had been suspended as a result of the incident. There will be ongoing mediation between the students involved in the physical and verbal altercation, which will involve police, teachers, and the families of the students.\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=128, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=False, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: [128000, 9370, 5730, 553, 279, 2768, 3754, 4652, 304, 220, 4386, 11460, 13, 5321, 2612, 279, 12399, 1193, 11, 2085, 904, 1023, 1495, 382, 17064, 512, 24243, 324, 7278, 22609, 706, 1027, 6004, 315, 264, 2978, 17884, 100167, 16239, 27144, 4236, 520, 264, 2978, 304, 21972, 596, 9909, 1566, 7742, 13, 20783, 505, 41061, 6518, 5657, 5234, 6150, 11, 304, 13597, 81, 411, 11, 39008, 11, 6244, 6532, 304, 264, 43510, 4465, 44779, 287, 2391, 279, 2978, 1938, 304, 902, 4236, 1051, 15753, 311, 279, 5015, 323, 22655, 46671, 13, 578, 100167, 19755, 3940, 994, 1403, 1060, 11888, 4236, 6137, 30674, 85207, 323, 24465, 810, 4236, 304, 994, 389, 7349, 388, 15753, 1884, 11509, 3221, 279, 4465, 13, 23198, 1523, 369, 2835, 13, 20783, 505, 41061, 6518, 5657, 5234, 6150, 11, 304, 13597, 81, 411, 11, 39008, 11, 6244, 6532, 304, 264, 43510, 4465, 1566, 7742, 13, 20783, 505, 279, 2978, 1051, 15753, 311, 279, 5015, 323, 22655, 46671, 13, 578, 100167, 19755, 3940, 994, 1403, 1060, 11888, 4236, 6137, 30674, 85207, 13, 364, 2460, 9191, 13305, 1051, 17919, 682, 4288, 7724, 1139, 433, 323, 430, 753, 1268, 433, 2751, 11493, 323, 11493, 2965, 264, 5575, 505, 41061, 6518, 5657, 5234, 3309, 220, 24, 10189, 13, 578, 22609, 5039, 4236, 35101, 11, 68981, 832, 2500, 323, 23062, 7013, 13, 3861, 3828, 374, 304, 279, 6278, 315, 279, 293, 1059, 2785, 1912, 11, 323, 8111, 311, 4498, 311, 279, 5015, 1234, 279, 3440, 13, 18814, 7009, 1051, 60, 68981, 1077, 304, 279, 3663, 323, 23062, 1077, 7013, 11, 1070, 574, 779, 1790, 35101, 433, 574, 3794, 779, 8545, 2965, 2500, 5575, 3309, 220, 24, 10189, 13, 364, 40, 7846, 1431, 3351, 358, 574, 3794, 15753, 2212, 1606, 315, 1268, 1690, 1274, 1051, 304, 279, 4465, 3238, 6104, 279, 5811, 44853, 1990, 1403, 27144, 4236, 11, 10195, 4236, 19755, 6532, 5694, 11, 2737, 4236, 505, 1060, 220, 806, 13, 578, 22609, 5039, 4236, 35101, 11, 68981, 832, 2500, 323, 23062, 7013, 13, 3861, 3828, 374, 304, 279, 6278, 315, 279, 293, 1059, 2785, 1912, 11, 323, 8111, 311, 4498, 311, 279, 5015, 1234, 279, 3440, 13, 578, 22609, 5039, 264, 8762, 53302, 364, 61296, 11, 636, 704, 315, 1618, 6, 439, 279, 100167, 9731, 311, 89690, 13, 362, 11326, 17644, 311, 1464, 709, 279, 100167, 11, 323, 433, 374, 16365, 430, 4379, 1051, 2663, 311, 9604, 279, 6237, 13, 5629, 12576, 574, 38018, 311, 3892, 4236, 11, 719, 1070, 1051, 912, 6129, 15319, 29759, 555, 1884, 6532, 13, 39008, 11930, 9675, 44692, 26987, 1604, 68, 11007, 430, 4330, 4236, 1047, 1027, 22340, 439, 264, 1121, 315, 279, 10672, 13, 2684, 690, 387, 14529, 77673, 1990, 279, 4236, 6532, 304, 279, 7106, 323, 36870, 98787, 11, 902, 690, 21736, 4379, 11, 13639, 11, 323, 279, 8689, 315, 279, 4236, 382, 19791, 25], prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

The car was completely destroyed and residents in 10 homes surrounding Dryandra Street and Wattle Street in O'Connor North Canberra were evacuated on Wednesday morning. Dramatic images captured by a local resident show the car completely engulfed in flames as firefighters battle to put them out, reports\xa0ABC. Firefighters battle to contain the raging fire that broke out after lightening struck a vehicle in North Canberra. Firefighter Danny Brighenti said it was unclear whether the car was parked or moving when the lightening struck. 'On arrival the person had got out of the vehicle, but the car was heavily involved in fire with the surrounding trees and bushes. They're not injured... but the car is totally destroyed.' The car burst into flames at about 7.50am during a brief thunderstorm. Firefighters were reportedly baffled by the blaze, which continued to reignite for about two hours. 'They believed there was a ruptured fuel tank which was causing the car to reignite,' Mr Brighenti said. Firefighters were reportedly baffled by the blaze, which was being reignited by a gas blaze underneath the car. A man cheated death after escaping the car without injury, despite the vehicle being completely destroyed by the blaze. Firefighters eventually moved the car away when they realised a gas main had been ruptured, at which point they set up an exclusion zone.

Joyce Hardin Garrard faces the death penalty or life without parole for the February 2012 death of Savannah Hardin, after the verdict was delivered on Friday. Garrard showed no reaction when the verdict was read, but she hugged her three attorneys before being led out of court by deputies. She glared toward the audience as she walked out silently. Scroll down for video. Joyce Hardin Garrard is led back to the Etowah County Detention Center in Gadsden, Alabama, after being found guilty of capital murder. She made granddaughter\xa0Savannah Hardin, 9, run for three hours as punishment in 2012. The youngster collapsed and had a seizure after carrying wood. She died three days later in hospital. Some of her relatives sitting behind her began to cry. Defense attorney Dani Bone laid his head on the table in front of him after the verdict, delivered after about 3½ hours of deliberation. Garrard\'s husband, Johnny, sat behind her, hugging a crying daughter before the daughter ran from the courtroom sobbing. Garrard is scheduled to be sentenced on Monday. Jurors will hear additional testimony and make a decision on whether to recommend life without parole or death. The final decision is up to the judge. Authorities claimed the 49-year-old woman forced Savannah to run and carry wood for hours as punishment for a lie about candy. Savannah eventually had a seizure and died three days later in a hospital. The defense denied the woman meant the girl any harm, but jurors rejected that claim. Garrard had testified she only made the girl pick up sticks in her yard as punishment the day of her collapse. Garrard testified that the girl did run, but only as practice for races at school. Prosecutors contended that Garrard refused to let Savannah stop running even after the girl was vomiting and begging for an end to the exercise. In court, they cited a school bus surveillance video that captured Garrard saying she would run the girl and teach her a lesson. Garrard walks to the Etowah County Judicial Building on Friday to prepare for a hearing. She now faces the death penalty or life without parole. Assistant District Attorney Carol Griffith said Garrard killed the child intentionally by berating her and making her run around the yard picking up sticks. \'She was tortured,\' Griffith said. Defense attorney Richard Rhea had portrayed his client as a devoted grandmother who was helping to look after 9-year-old Savannah while the girl\'s father was overseas working as a contractor for the U.S. State Department. Some witnesses who testified about seeing Garrard force Savannah to run seemed more upset in recalling the scene from the stand than Garrard appeared to be, Griffith said. But Rhea urged jurors to ask why none of the witnesses intervened if they thought the abuse was so awful that day. The 49-year-old walks in handcuffs around her feet, waist and arms, accompanied by two officers. He said, \'I think we have all had the thought: "If it was that bad, why didn\'t they do something?\'\' He said witnesses didn\'t notify police about their concerns until days later, after they heard girl was on life support. \'Then it becomes "Oh yeah, I witnessed boot camp. I witnessed the drill sergeant from hell",\' he said. Garrard was the final witness to testify on Wednesday and attorneys for both sides concluded their closing arguments Friday afternoon. Garrard has been in jail awaiting trial for three years, and that time typically would be applied to any potential sentence. Savannah\'s stepmother Jessica Mae Hardin has also been charged with her murder, which carries a life sentence. The girl was in the care of her stepmother and grandmother while her father was away. Hardin, who is awaiting trial, gave birth while in custody in February 2012. A 911 operator told the court Garrard asked \'for a smoke\' while the girl was unconscious outside their home.\n\nSummary:', params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0,

The Slovakia international, currently away preparing for a Euro 2016 qualifier at home to Luxembourg on Friday, failed in his appeal against a violent conduct charge. Skrtel had argued the action of standing on De Gea's right shin as he chased a through-ball in the final seconds of Sunday's 2-1 defeat at Anfield was unintentional but an independent panel disagreed with him. Martin Skrtel's foot lands on David de Gea's leg in the incident which saw the FA charge the defender. A three-man panel of former elite officials reviewed the footage after it was missed by Martin Atkinson (right) Skrtel could have been in more trouble for posting this picture of clowns after the FA upheld his  ban. The 30-year-old has continued to profess his innocence even after his ban was confirmed, meaning he misses Premier League matches against Arsenal and Newcastle, plus an FA Cup quarter-final replay at Blackburn. 'It feels strange because we appealed against those charges and still I was hit by a three-match ban,' he told his personal website martin-skrtel.com. 'I didn't want to stamp on him. It was an accident and I didn't do it on purpose. I don't feel guilty. It was a long ball and he went towards me and I wanted to jump over him. Simple as that.' The defender is unlikely to punished after he posted a picture of clowns on his Instagram account on Wednesday - which has been widely viewed as his comment on those who sat on the panel and decided the outcome of the hearing. Steven Gerrard will also miss three games after seeing red for this stamp during the 2-1 defeat. Captain Gerrard was sent off after stamping on Manchester United's Ander Herrera on Sunday. Skrtel will be joined on the sidelines by Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard, who will also serve a similar three-match ban after his moment of madness saw him sent off less than a minute after coming on as a substitute for the second half after stamping on United midfielder Ander Herrera. With Skrtel and several of his team-mates away on international duty the club's Under 21 squad have been invited to train at the first-team's Melwood base. However, one of their number Jordan Lussey will be getting competitive action elsewhere after completed a loan move to Bolton, currently 17th in the Sky Bet Championship. The 20-year-old follows the likes of Sheyi Ojo and Jerome Sinclair, who have both joined relegation-threatened Championship side Wigan on loan in the last six weeks to gain first-team football experience.\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=128, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=False, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: [128000, 9370, 5730, 553, 279, 2768, 3754, 4652, 304, 220, 4386, 11460, 13, 5321, 2612, 279, 12399, 1193, 11, 2085, 904, 1023, 1495, 382, 17064, 512, 93705, 29315, 11826, 4923, 3423, 301, 43446, 568, 1587, 539, 2733, 16390, 922, 279, 8815, 389, 19922, 3723, 63300, 6941, 409, 4323, 64, 902, 19543, 304, 813, 2380, 46804, 9120, 13, 578, 81785, 6625, 11, 5131, 3201, 20646, 369, 264, 20026, 220, 679, 21, 61747, 520, 2162, 311, 65971, 389, 6740, 11, 4745, 304, 813, 14638, 2403, 264, 16806, 6929, 6900, 13, 4923, 3423, 301, 1047, 18784, 279, 1957, 315, 11509, 389, 1611, 4323, 64, 596, 1314, 77111, 439, 568, 62920, 264, 1555, 68302, 304, 279, 1620, 6622, 315, 7418, 596, 220, 17, 12, 16, 18506, 520, 1556, 2630, 574, 70576, 278, 719, 459, 9678, 7090, 71803, 449, 1461, 13, 11826, 4923, 3423, 301, 596, 4579, 12098, 389, 6941, 409, 4323, 64, 596, 2531, 304, 279, 10672, 902, 5602, 279, 15358, 6900, 279, 29315, 13, 362, 2380, 21110, 7090, 315, 4846, 21342, 7510, 22690, 279, 22609, 1306, 433, 574, 13942, 555, 11826, 2468, 51547, 320, 1315, 8, 4923, 3423, 301, 1436, 617, 1027, 304, 810, 12544, 369, 17437, 420, 6945, 315, 1206, 43456, 1306, 279, 15358, 62411, 813, 220, 9120, 13, 578, 220, 966, 4771, 6418, 706, 8738, 311, 35578, 813, 57311, 1524, 1306, 813, 9120, 574, 11007, 11, 7438, 568, 43394, 20210, 9130, 9248, 2403, 33102, 323, 44226, 11, 5636, 459, 15358, 11098, 8502, 55962, 35585, 520, 89453, 13, 364, 2181, 11321, 15234, 1606, 584, 53382, 2403, 1884, 10405, 323, 2103, 358, 574, 4295, 555, 264, 2380, 46804, 9120, 2965, 568, 3309, 813, 4443, 3997, 96016, 46407, 3423, 301, 916, 13, 364, 40, 3287, 956, 1390, 311, 21899, 389, 1461, 13, 1102, 574, 459, 11677, 323, 358, 3287, 956, 656, 433, 389, 7580, 13, 358, 1541, 956, 2733, 16390, 13, 1102, 574, 264, 1317, 5041, 323, 568, 4024, 7119, 757, 323, 358, 4934, 311, 7940, 927, 1461, 13, 9170, 439, 430, 3238, 578, 29315, 374, 17821, 311, 41998, 1306, 568, 8621, 264, 6945, 315, 1206, 43456, 389, 813, 14318, 2759, 389, 8079, 482, 902, 706, 1027, 13882, 19894, 439, 813, 4068, 389, 1884, 889, 7731, 389, 279, 7090, 323, 6773, 279, 15632, 315, 279, 11011, 13, 24565, 86965, 569, 690, 1101, 3194, 2380, 3953, 1306, 9298, 2579, 369, 420, 21899, 2391, 279, 220, 17, 12, 16, 18506, 13, 22022, 86965, 569, 574, 3288, 1022, 1306, 21899, 287, 389, 19922, 3723, 596, 362, 910, 97108, 389, 7418, 13, 4923, 3423, 301, 690, 387, 11096, 389, 279, 70513, 555, 25715, 24862, 24565, 86965, 569, 11, 889, 690, 1101, 8854, 264, 4528, 2380, 46804, 9120, 1306, 813, 4545, 315, 52819, 5602, 1461, 3288, 1022, 2753, 1109, 264, 9568, 1306, 5108, 389, 439, 264, 28779, 369, 279, 2132, 4376, 1306, 21899, 287, 389, 3723, 45067, 362, 910, 97108, 13, 3161, 4923, 3423, 301, 323, 3892, 315, 813, 2128, 1474, 988, 3201, 389, 6625, 14523, 279, 6469, 596, 9636, 220, 1691, 19037, 617, 1027, 18719, 311, 5542, 520, 279, 1176, 43942, 596, 11220, 6798, 2385, 13, 4452, 11, 832, 315, 872, 1396, 17527, 445, 355, 8674, 690, 387, 3794, 15022, 1957, 18403, 1306, 8308, 264, 11941, 3351, 311, 62677, 11, 5131, 220, 1114, 339, 304, 279, 15064, 13315, 19134, 13, 578, 220, 508, 4771, 6418, 11263, 279, 13452, 315, 3005, 39172, 507, 7453, 323, 70874, 74289, 11, 889, 617, 2225, 11096, 59782, 367, 56844, 6901, 19134, 3185, 468, 11118, 389, 11941, 304, 279, 1566, 4848, 5672, 311, 8895, 1176, 43942, 9141, 3217, 382, 19791, 25], prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

The exhibition, which ran across the summer, is an interactive experience that encourages children to draw and create accessories inspired by the work of Romance Was Born.\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=128, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=False, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: [128000, 9370, 5730, 553, 279, 2768, 3754, 4652, 304, 220, 4386, 11460, 13, 5321, 2612, 279, 12399, 1193, 11, 2085, 904, 1023, 1495, 382, 17064, 512, 64797, 8494, 27535, 31700, 17772, 3782, 311, 264, 3345, 389, 7418, 3814, 449, 264, 6800, 37398, 15864, 555, 52256, 15148, 38916, 13, 7054, 27972, 63908, 21750, 323, 37105, 39760, 15203, 279, 52861, 12512, 14769, 505, 279, 13673, 2440, 596, 5652, 4526, 11, 14409, 15852, 13, 578, 362, 22964, 679, 20, 1584, 5097, 20343, 505, 3297, 29479, 65, 596, 27373, 480, 22082, 332, 93792, 2911, 596, 6603, 11, 1071, 26897, 24101, 1856, 3200, 7211, 323, 25459, 16207, 13, 10517, 5767, 1604, 25, 578, 1620, 52861, 1501, 520, 11463, 8494, 27535, 31700, 17772, 574, 264, 15864, 555, 52256, 15148, 38916, 13, 6126, 12699, 25, 578, 14409, 15852, 4526, 574, 14948, 555, 3297, 84651, 6, 28530, 2911, 82, 6, 2363, 4101, 11, 4194, 21380, 50428, 19644, 323, 356, 76084, 20898, 13, 37105, 9922, 12512, 264, 3776, 40126, 84273, 449, 10107, 14071, 67272, 645, 6319, 311, 52280, 264, 10068, 1645, 28139, 6136, 13, 578, 49217, 13444, 28670, 459, 1645, 28139, 2010, 23164, 11, 323, 1077, 1304, 709, 15109, 938, 23707, 2579, 54888, 1120, 439, 279, 23008, 42281, 480, 22082, 332, 93792, 6, 505, 13358, 50428, 19644, 323, 356, 76084, 20898, 6603, 13, 37105, 1101, 28670, 8987, 3776, 8071, 12737, 323, 54088, 6968, 264, 18460, 8071, 6211, 11, 1418, 63908, 1047, 279, 1890, 1427, 304, 46258, 15310, 13, 15457, 892, 25, 37105, 39760, 9922, 304, 264, 26435, 84273, 449, 1645, 28139, 6136, 11, 323, 37260, 1828, 311, 279, 3446, 596, 40148, 11, 38866, 689, 2418, 11, 304, 420, 90825, 10885, 13, 22037, 14948, 25, 578, 480, 22082, 332, 93792, 1051, 279, 2867, 20343, 4920, 2955, 34821, 4194, 57856, 1856, 3200, 7211, 323, 25459, 16207, 6, 1584, 13, 22591, 25, 578, 23008, 42281, 480, 22082, 332, 93792, 3446, 11, 4194, 21380, 50428, 19644, 323, 356, 76084, 20898, 11, 574, 1176, 4756, 304, 220, 7529, 23, 13, 37105, 8621, 264, 90825, 6945, 389, 14318, 53004, 1828, 311, 264, 17661, 430, 7111, 1093, 264, 38866, 689, 2418, 482, 279, 40148, 505, 279, 28530, 6603, 13, 63908, 21750, 15203, 279, 8415, 19599, 304, 264, 384, 1791, 5893, 418, 355, 6307, 8679, 84273, 449, 3776, 19837, 11, 45484, 3876, 449, 264, 3776, 15631, 1565, 9072, 84273, 449, 42365, 31049, 13, 5046, 279, 4526, 11, 52256, 15148, 38916, 1071, 433, 574, 14948, 555, 364, 45459, 685, 15148, 38916, 596, 65875, 369, 20587, 7493, 323, 19226, 11, 1057, 5426, 32726, 3297, 84651, 323, 1077, 23008, 42281, 480, 22082, 332, 93792, 323, 279, 11542, 315, 7982, 709, 304, 279, 13673, 704, 1445, 3238, 3061, 6347, 323, 100014, 25, 27972, 28670, 53862, 304, 7138, 53161, 24370, 449, 70467, 31449, 11549, 1304, 709, 311, 23606, 279, 10107, 14769, 13, 452, 537, 24823, 292, 25, 52256, 15148, 38916, 1614, 430, 814, 7318, 35491, 311, 364, 3124, 5812, 7493, 323, 19226, 6, 323, 7982, 709, 304, 279, 13673, 4470, 1445, 13, 4740, 11888, 1938, 315, 52861, 38480, 323, 3361, 4455, 11, 279, 650, 1428, 1785, 15676, 1501, 574, 5762, 520, 279, 5165, 19853, 315, 23225, 13, 578, 20619, 53, 374, 1101, 279, 2816, 315, 1856, 3200, 7211, 323, 16207, 6, 17855, 60005, 28099, 20034, 520, 2911, 11, 902, 8640, 3156, 5936, 220, 717, 13, 578, 28099, 11, 902, 10837, 4028, 279, 7474, 11, 374, 459, 21416, 3217, 430, 37167, 2911, 311, 4128, 323, 1893, 23090, 14948, 555, 279, 990, 315, 52256, 15148, 38916, 382, 19791, 25], prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

Please output the summary only, without any other text.\n\nArticle:\nWashington (CNN)A Florida "dream ticket," two nuggets about leadership questions in Congress and coming tests for Sen. Ted Cruz and Ohio Gov. John Kasich filled our final March trip around the "Inside Politics" table. 1.  Another "Draft Warren" movement? If you follow politics, you have heard this one: Liberals say Elizabeth Warren has to run for president because Hillary Clinton is too cozy with Wall Street. And now that Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid is planning to retire -- creating an opening in the top Senate Democratic job -- you are about to hear this: Warren has to run for leader because Chuck Schumer is too cozy with Wall Street. The senator from Massachusetts is likely to give the same answer as she did on a presidential run, but Jackie Kucinich of The Daily Beast says the liberal clamoring tells us something about anxiety on the left. "What this does show is there is a lot of skepticism with the base with Chuck Schumer, because he\'s so close to Wall Street, and it\'s an issue they\'ve really been hammering on," Kucinich said. "So watch for more of that, because I have a feeling that they are going to make their voices heard, through Warren or not." 2.  A good week for Boehner. Yes, you read that right. It has been a rocky year for House Speaker John Boehner, but his allies think they may have just turned a corner. The House of Representatives passed the Republican budget last week as well as a big Medicare change known as the "doc fix" because it clarifies reimbursement rates to Medicare providers. NPR\'s Juana Summers shared reporting on how Team Boehner hopes that ending the month with a little momentum will carry over when other big legislative battles come to the fore. "Part of (his success) is because of the speaker\'s willingness to use unconventional tactics, to work with Democrat Nancy Pelosi for that Medicare reform," Summers said. "Congress has a lot of big deadlines when they return. So whether or not he can hold onto that power instead of seeing it slip will be really fascinating." 3. Bush-Rubio? Rubio-Bush? Watch the real estate listings! Jeb Bush and Sen. Marco Rubio both call Florida home. And both want to be the Republican nominee for president. They also happen to be on friendly terms. So among Florida Republicans who love them both -- there is talk of a "dream ticket." Of course, it won\'t happen. Can\'t happen. Rules and all that pertaining to the president and vice president coming from the same state. (Dick Cheney changed his residency from Texas to Wyoming right before joining the George W. Bush ticket.) But Ed O\'Keefe of The Washington Post said the obstacles aren\'t preventing Florida Republicans from doing a little dreaming. "They say, look, Bush has all this executive experience, he\'s bilingual, he has a Mexican-American wife," O\'Keefe said. "Rubio is young.  He has an interest in foreign policy. Why not?" 4. Ted Cruz wants to "rock" the youth vote. Much was made of the fact that Liberty University students had no choice but to attend the campus convocation at which Ted Cruz announced his bid for the Republican presidential nomination. But it gave Cruz a big crowd -- and Robert Costa of The Washington Post reports that Team Cruz is determined to build a relationship with young conservatives such as those on hand for the announcement. "He\'s playing at a lot of happy hours with young conservatives in the coming weeks and months," Costa said. "And he really believes he can ignite those young conservatives, who aren\'t really familiar with Bush and are looking for someone new." 5. Is Kasich waiting for a "summer wave"? John Kasich had a well-regarded visit to New Hampshire last week. And he got a decent buzz out of a New York fund-raising stop, too. So is he ready to launch and join the crowded GOP 2016 presidential field? Not so fast. Two New Hampshire Republicans keeping close tabs on GOP visitors say he wouldn\'t give a firm answer about his intentions -- something they took as a hesitation to run. A national GOP source plugged into to the Kasich operation says the governor hasn\'t made a firm decision, and is talking about waiting until the summer to make a final call. That, too, is interpreted widely as a reluctance to run. This national source said Kasich is one of two GOP governors who want to wait and see if those in the current field stumble after their official spring rollouts and create an opening for a "summer wave" of new entries. The other, according to this source, is GOP Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder.\n\nSummary:', params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[],

Please output the summary only, without any other text.\n\nArticle:\nFormer Liverpool players including Fernando Torres, Pepe Reina and Xabi Alonso are poised to return to Anfield for a special charity match at the end of this month. Steven Gerrard has thrown his support behind plans to stage a game during the international break on Sunday, March 29 which would feature team-mates from his 17-year career. John Arne Riise and Luis Garcia have confirmed they will take part while Sportsmail's Jamie Carragher is also due to be involved. Striker Fernando Torres, now at Atletico Madrid, scored 81 goals in 142 appearances for Liverpool. Xabi Alonso (right), who now plays at Bayern Munich, was a fan favourite during his five-year spell at Anfield. Pepe Reina played nearly 400 games for Liverpool during a successful eight-year stay on Merseyside. Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard (left) is fully behind the charity match that could raise over £500,000. Proceeds from the game would benefit the local community with the Liverpool FC Foundation likely to be the main beneficiary if it goes ahead. A full house at Anfield could generate in excess of £500,000. Torres, Reina and Alonso are among those who have been invited to play, although their involvement depends on international call-ups and also permission from their club sides. Luis Suarez is unlikely to be there as Uruguay face Morocco in a friendly in Agadir on Saturday, March 28. Javier Mascherano has the same problem with Argentina scheduled to face El Salvador and Ecuador.

A summer of despair at St Mary's has been followed by a quite remarkable season, leaving Saints sixth in the standings with just nine matches remaining. Last weekend's 1-1 draw at Chelsea boosted their hopes of European qualification - a match in which Alderweireld performed fantastically on his return from a hamstring injury. It was a positive display after a frustrating time of late and the Belgium international knows Saints have to follow it up with a win at home to Burnley on Saturday. Toby Alderweireld is keen for Southampton to keep winning to maintain the push for Europe. 'It was great after two months seeing from the sidelines to play again,' Alderweireld said. 'With a bit of luck, a good defence and a great goalkeeper we got a point. 'It's important we don't look too far in the future because it won't help. We can be happy with the point at Chelsea, but if we lose on Saturday what does it mean? 'We want to achieve something good, something special this season, so we have to win. That's game by game. We can't play a different game on Saturday, it's Burnley. Alderweirel challenges Diego Costa for the ball during Southampton's 1-1 draw with Chelsea. 'We really want to achieve something very special for Southampton. We have nine games, nine finals; we have very tough games left. 'Let's get the three points with the supporters on Saturday, that's the first final.' Burnley arrive at St Mary's in the relegation zone yet buoyed by last weekend's win against champions Manchester City. Sean Dyche's men also got the better of Saints when they met earlier in the campaign and Alderweireld is eyeing revenge. 'It's going to be difficult because they are in a good mood, they have had good performances in the last few weeks so they have confidence,' he told Southampton's official YouTube channel. Alderweireld is looking for revenge when Southampton face Burnley after they were beaten earlier in the season. 'But at home, we need to win. We can put the pressure on us because of the season we have had, we have to do that, especially at home. 'We have to be patient, show good quality on the ball and look out for the counter. 'In the last game we deserved to win I think. We had the better chances and they had none really. 'We had the throw-in and then they scored, it was very unlucky. We could have won there so we want to get a little revenge. 'They have a lot of good players. That's the Premier League. When you're not 100 per cent, anyone can beat you, that's what people like about the Premier League. 'We have to be 100 per cent. They are in a good mood so we have to be at our best. 'I don't think this group is over confident. We are focused and we know we have to show the quality on the ball.'\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=128, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=False, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: [128000, 9370, 5730, 553, 279, 2768, 3754, 4652, 304, 220, 4386, 11460, 13, 5321, 2612, 279, 12399, 1193, 11, 2085, 904, 1023, 1495, 382, 17064, 512, 51, 28113, 31447, 261, 906, 556, 509, 8964, 62251, 1205, 311, 9567, 18530, 3258, 420, 9178, 422, 814, 527, 311, 10519, 872, 4585, 369, 7665, 9141, 13, 362, 7474, 315, 46996, 520, 800, 10455, 596, 706, 1027, 8272, 555, 264, 5115, 23649, 3280, 11, 9564, 33319, 26084, 304, 279, 68663, 449, 1120, 11888, 9248, 9861, 13, 8155, 9178, 596, 220, 16, 12, 16, 4128, 520, 27616, 65208, 872, 16388, 315, 7665, 46160, 482, 264, 2489, 304, 902, 31447, 261, 906, 556, 509, 10887, 8755, 36419, 389, 813, 471, 505, 264, 90805, 11134, 13, 1102, 574, 264, 6928, 3113, 1306, 264, 35711, 892, 315, 3389, 323, 279, 34061, 6625, 8964, 33319, 617, 311, 1833, 433, 709, 449, 264, 3243, 520, 2162, 311, 18530, 3258, 389, 7884, 13, 79479, 31447, 261, 906, 556, 509, 374, 27989, 369, 62251, 311, 2567, 11230, 311, 10519, 279, 4585, 369, 4606, 13, 364, 2181, 574, 2294, 1306, 1403, 4038, 9298, 505, 279, 70513, 311, 1514, 1578, 2965, 31447, 261, 906, 556, 509, 1071, 13, 364, 2409, 264, 2766, 315, 15369, 11, 264, 1695, 23682, 323, 264, 2294, 63300, 584, 2751, 264, 1486, 13, 364, 2181, 596, 3062, 584, 1541, 956, 1427, 2288, 3117, 304, 279, 3938, 1606, 433, 2834, 956, 1520, 13, 1226, 649, 387, 6380, 449, 279, 1486, 520, 27616, 11, 719, 422, 584, 9229, 389, 7884, 1148, 1587, 433, 3152, 30, 364, 1687, 1390, 311, 11322, 2555, 1695, 11, 2555, 3361, 420, 3280, 11, 779, 584, 617, 311, 3243, 13, 3011, 596, 1847, 555, 1847, 13, 1226, 649, 956, 1514, 264, 2204, 1847, 389, 7884, 11, 433, 596, 18530, 3258, 13, 31447, 261, 906, 556, 75, 11774, 18842, 32380, 369, 279, 5041, 2391, 62251, 596, 220, 16, 12, 16, 4128, 449, 27616, 13, 364, 1687, 2216, 1390, 311, 11322, 2555, 1633, 3361, 369, 62251, 13, 1226, 617, 11888, 3953, 11, 11888, 41402, 26, 584, 617, 1633, 11292, 3953, 2163, 13, 364, 10267, 596, 636, 279, 2380, 3585, 449, 279, 15879, 389, 7884, 11, 430, 596, 279, 1176, 1620, 3238, 18530, 3258, 17782, 520, 800, 10455, 596, 304, 279, 59782, 367, 10353, 3686, 75720, 291, 555, 1566, 9178, 596, 3243, 2403, 34838, 19922, 4409, 13, 26044, 43048, 1557, 596, 3026, 1101, 2751, 279, 2731, 315, 33319, 994, 814, 2322, 6931, 304, 279, 4901, 323, 31447, 261, 906, 556, 509, 374, 8071, 287, 37169, 13, 364, 2181, 596, 2133, 311, 387, 5107, 1606, 814, 527, 304, 264, 1695, 20247, 11, 814, 617, 1047, 1695, 24601, 304, 279, 1566, 2478, 5672, 779, 814, 617, 12410, 2965, 568, 3309, 62251, 596, 4033, 13674, 5613, 13, 31447, 261, 906, 556, 509, 374, 3411, 369, 37169, 994, 62251, 3663, 18530, 3258, 1306, 814, 1051, 31394, 6931, 304, 279, 3280, 13, 364, 4071, 520, 2162, 11, 584, 1205, 311, 3243, 13, 1226, 649, 2231, 279, 7410, 389, 603, 1606, 315, 279, 3280, 584, 617, 1047, 11, 584, 617, 311, 656, 430, 11, 5423, 520, 2162, 13, 364, 1687, 617, 311, 387, 8893, 11, 1501, 1695, 4367, 389, 279, 5041, 323, 1427, 704, 369, 279, 5663, 13, 364, 644, 279, 1566, 1847, 584, 45547, 311, 3243, 358, 1781, 13, 1226, 1047, 279, 2731, 17393, 323, 814, 1047, 7000, 2216, 13, 364, 1687, 1047, 279, 2571, 3502, 323, 1243, 814, 16957, 11, 433, 574, 1633, 89544, 13, 1226, 1436, 617, 2834, 1070, 779, 584, 1390, 311, 636, 264, 2697, 37169, 13, 364, 7009, 617, 264, 2763, 315, 1695, 4311, 13, 3011, 596, 279, 20210, 9130, 13, 3277, 499, 2351, 539, 220, 1041, 824, 2960, 11, 5606, 649, 9567, 499, 11, 430, 596, 1148, 1274, 1093, 922, 279, 20210, 9130, 13, 364, 1687, 617, 311, 387, 220, 1041, 824, 2960, 13, 2435, 527, 304, 264, 1695, 20247, 779, 584, 617, 311, 387, 520, 1057, 1888, 13, 364, 40, 1541, 956, 1781, 420, 1912, 374, 927, 16913, 13, 1226, 527, 10968, 323, 584, 1440, 584, 617, 311, 1501, 279, 4367, 389, 279, 5041, 22438, 19791, 25], prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

Dean Wilson, 37, accused his father of sleeping with his former partner and then warned:\xa0'If I don't kill you now, I'll be back'. Norman Wilson initially laughed because his son's disturbing promise reminded him of Arnold Schwarzenegger's famous line from the film The Terminator. Now the 60-year-old, from Chesterfield, Derbyshire, is so terrified he is planning to move away, the court heard. Dean Wilson (left), 37, was jailed after running over his father Norman (right) with his Mazda because he was convinced he had slept with his ex-girlfriend, a court heard. Speaking from his home today, Mr Wilson said he is living in fear since his son went to jail. He said: 'I am traumatised by what happened. I need to move away. Everytime I look out of my front window onto where it happened I have a flashback.' 'I can remember feeling my ribs crack one by one as he reversed over me. 'Then he put one foot on the accelerator and one on the break to spin the wheel round to rip my skin off my legs. 'It was excruciating.' He added he has no clue where the idea that he had had an affair with Dean Wilson's ex-partner came from, insisting 'it never happened'. Norman, a retired recycling worker, said his son had three children with Elizabeth Marshall but that he only saw his grandchildren in passing in the street. 'He's not even with her anymore, I heard he was seeing someone else. Dean was accusing me of having an affair with her five years ago,' he added. The 60-year-old added he would never be rebuilding his relationship with his son, and felt he was constantly on the lookout for fear he would send someone to hurt him. 'I can't sleep at night or concentrate; I'm always looking over my shoulder. I don't know who his mates are. If my son says he'll be back, he'll be back. 'I've got to get away and move on with my life.' The defendant, who the court heard has a record of anxiety and depression, was arrested after going to Chesterfield Royal Hospital's mental health unit and admitting running over his father. Norman Wilson was treated for broken ribs, bruising (pictured) and grazes after he was run over by his son. He later told police he was certain his father had slept with his ex-girlfriend and that he drove over him twice because he was angry - but he denied trying to kill his father. Dean Wilson was charged with attempted murder, before the charge was dropped and changed to causing grievous bodily harm with intent, which he admitted in court. He was jailed for six years at Nottingham Crown Court on Monday. Prosecuting the case, Dawn Pritchard, said: 'The windscreen of Norman Wilson's Ford Focus had been smashed and he was out vacuuming the car when he heard a screech. 'He turned and saw his son saying he didn't want his kids or his ex-partner at his dad's house or he would kill him. 'Norman Wilson said the defendant indicated he had smashed the windscreen. 'The defendant said he had been told Norman had been going to bed with his ex and Dean Wilson said he was going to kill him and added, 'If I don't kill you now, I'll be back'.' Ms Pritchard added: 'The defendant then jumped in his car and came at speed and hit Norman Wilson so he was thrown in the air and as he landed a few yards from his own vehicle the defendant drove at him again and ran over his leg.' Witnesses said they saw the defendant drive the Mazda at his father before reversing over him. The 60-year-old (pictured today), who is now left using a mobility scooter, is terrified and planning to move. Norman Wilson initially laughed at his son's threat but now the 60-year-old, from Chesterfield, Derbyshire, is terrified after being run over outside his home (pictured) Natalie Mosley, who witnessed the incident, told the court that she put herself in the path of Dean Wilson's vehicle during another attempt to drive over him. Ms Pritchard explained how Norman Wilson remembers someone holding his head and saying he was dying when things became blurred. He was treated for broken ribs, bruising and grazes at Sheffield Northern General Hospital and is now left using a mobility scooter. In a victim impact statement, Mr Wilson said he feels threatened and that he has to leave the area. Matthew Donkin, defending, said: 'Dean Wilson behaved out of character and gave leave to all of his good senses. 'He has been the principle carer for his children aged seven and eight and his 14-year-old stepson. 'There was a lack of premeditation until he got in his vehicle. He immediately admitted what he had done and made full admissions.' Sentencing, Judge Michael Stokes said: 'Your relationship with your father broke down badly by your suspicions that rightly or wrongly he was involved sexually with your former partner. 'Travelling at a speed estimated at 20mph you drove at him and knocked him into the road and you then quite deliberately reversed over him. 'He was extremely lucky not to have sustained more serious injuries.' Dean Wilson was also handed a four year driving ban and told his car would be confiscated. Dean Wilson was charged with attempted murder, which was later dropped and changed to causing grievous bodily harm with intent, which he admitted at Nottingham Crown Court (pictured)\n\nSummary:",

Please output the summary only, without any other text.\n\nArticle:\n(CNN)Those Hannibal Buress jokes about Bill Cosby? They\'ve been no laughing matter to Buress, he told Jimmy Kimmel. "It\'s definitely a weird situation," the comedian said on Wednesday\'s show. "I get a lot of messages from people about it." Well, maybe some of them are a laughing matter. One of those messages, Buress continued, was a "death threat from a male bodybuilder-slash-stripper on Facebook." And there was a twist: He and the bodybuilder had one mutual friend. It made for an awkward situation, Buress said. "Having to hit your friend up and say, \'Hey, man, can you tell your buddy to stop saying he\'s going to murder me?\' " Buress kickstarted the recent Cosby controversy by referencing the rape allegations against the "Cosby Show" star in a routine. One video of Buress\' stand-up went viral. Since October, when Buress\' video was posted, more than 20 women have made or reiterated abuse claims against Cosby. Cosby himself has not directly addressed any of the accusations. His attorney, Martin D. Singer, has called the accusations "ridiculous." A concert with Bill Cosby: It\'s complicated. Buress, a star of "Broad City" and "The Eric Andre Show," is currently on a comedy tour.\n\nSummary:', params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=128, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=False, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: [128000, 9370, 5730, 553, 279, 2768, 3754, 4652, 304, 220, 4386, 11460, 13, 5321, 2612, 279, 12399, 1193, 11, 2085, 904, 1023, 1495, 382, 17064, 512, 3100, 9944, 8, 23025, 28829, 51629, 28326, 676, 32520, 922, 8766, 93051, 30, 2435, 3077, 1027, 912, 32681, 5030, 311, 28326, 676, 11, 568, 3309, 28933, 735, 65964, 13, 330, 2181, 596, 8659, 264, 16682, 6671, 1359, 279, 51912, 1071, 389, 8079, 596, 1501, 13, 330, 40, 636, 264, 2763, 315, 6743, 505, 1274, 922, 433, 1210, 8489, 11, 7344, 1063, 315, 1124, 527, 264, 32681, 5030, 13, 3861, 315, 1884, 6743, 11, 28326, 676, 8738, 11, 574, 264, 330, 63007, 6023, 505, 264, 8762, 2547, 18331, 1355, 25713, 5594, 94365, 389, 5690, 1210, 1628, 1070, 574, 264, 27744, 25, 1283, 323, 279, 2547, 18331, 1047, 832, 27848, 4333, 13, 1102, 1903, 369, 459, 29859, 6671, 11, 28326, 676, 1071, 13, 330, 29132, 311, 4295, 701, 4333, 709, 323, 2019, 11, 364, 19182, 11, 893, 11, 649, 499, 3371, 701, 37772, 311, 3009, 5605, 568, 596, 2133, 311, 10102, 757, 20837, 330, 28326, 676, 10536, 47823, 279, 3293, 93051, 26654, 555, 57616, 279, 17199, 18873, 2403, 279, 330, 55324, 1729, 7073, 1, 6917, 304, 264, 14348, 13, 3861, 2835, 315, 28326, 676, 6, 2559, 5352, 4024, 29962, 13, 8876, 6664, 11, 994, 28326, 676, 6, 2835, 574, 8621, 11, 810, 1109, 220, 508, 3278, 617, 1903, 477, 66847, 11737, 8349, 2403, 93051, 13, 93051, 5678, 706, 539, 6089, 20669, 904, 315, 279, 36569, 13, 5414, 14065, 11, 11826, 423, 13, 55770, 11, 706, 2663, 279, 36569, 330, 1907, 292, 13850, 1210, 362, 21497, 449, 8766, 93051, 25, 1102, 596, 17395, 13, 28326, 676, 11, 264, 6917, 315, 330, 69424, 4409, 1, 323, 330, 791, 16645, 27525, 7073, 1359, 374, 5131, 389, 264, 23160, 7364, 382, 19791, 25], prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

The frustrated Tannadice star claimed there have been ‘continual injustices’ across the three games between United and Celtic this month that have yielded six red cards - four for Jackie McNamara’s team. In the wake of the stormy 1-1 Scottish Cup draw at Tannadice, Celtic manager Ronny Deila and his captain Scott Brown both accused United kid Aidan Connolly of ‘diving’ to win his side a penalty. Paul Paton (right) believes Celtic'manipulate people' and have been doing so for the past few years. Despite Deila calling on the SFA to take action, none was forthcoming but United were subsequently denied a penalty when Brown barged Ryan Dow in the League Cup Final, won 2-0 by Celtic at Hampden last Sunday. And after the 4-0 Scottish Cup replay win at Parkhead on Wednesday, Deila accused Ryan McGowan of endangering the career of Liam Henderson with a wild lunge. But the United camp felt the reaction of Celtic’s players may have influenced Calum Murray’s decision to send the Australian off. The Dundee United star and Ronny Deila have previous when they clashed at Tannadice in the quarter-final. And ahead of the fourth and final match between United and Celtic at Parkhead in the Premiership on Saturday, Paton appeared to accuse Celtic of heaping pressure on match officials. ‘Ronny Deila has an opinion on everything but I don’t really read too much into what he has to say or who he puts pressure on,’ said Paton. ‘But I think Celtic as a club can manipulate people more than Dundee United can. That kind of thing has been happening for years. The tough tackling midfielder goes up for a header with Celtic star Nir Biton in the cup final on Sunday. ‘We have seen injustices in the last few games we have played and that causes frustration. It feels that we do not get any decisions and that it is continual. ‘I saw things differently (to Deila). I don’t think Ryan McGowan deserved to get sent off as he clearly won the ball. I don’t know if I am being biased but it is a hard tackle but he clearly won the ball. ‘I don’t think there was much in it (but) they have made a lot of it. It looked like a good tackle to me but that is only my opinion.’ Ryan McGowan (right) was sent off for a tackle on Conor Henderson and angered Celtic's players. Paton’s sense of injustice was also stoked by the failure of referee Murray to hand a second yellow to Efe Ambrose for a foul on Nadir Ciftci at 1-0. He continued: ‘I thought he was lucky to stay on the park but we have seen it in the last few meetings that we don’t seem to get things like that going for us against Celtic. ‘How he stayed on the park I will never know. It was a clear yellow card. But when you come to places like (Parkhead) you never seem to get these decisions. ‘I don’t know if it is just coincidence but you saw last weekend in the League Cup Final we should have had a clear penalty. Paton believes Efe Ambrose (centre) should also have been sent off for a second bookable offence. ‘Then Efe Ambrose should have got sent off when we were on top in the game and it did not happen. Small things like that change games.’ Paton also defended himself after Celtic’s Anthony Stokes yesterday accused the United midfielder of catching him with a ‘sly elbow’. Stokes was sent off for retaliation but later said on Twitter: ‘I get a sly elbow in the face by someone that has nothing about them and get sent off, typical!’ But Paton pleaded his innocence, saying: ‘I have ran across him and I don’t know if he thinks I have meant to hit him but he has lashed out and caught me on the side of the face. ‘I stepped across him and I don’t know if I have caught him with my leg or my arm. I honestly don’t know but it was certainly not intentional. ‘But there’s no edge between the two teams. It’s been taken out of context as there were not really any bad challenges in the game. We come back to Parkhead on Saturday in the league with a clean slate.’\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0,

Please output the summary only, without any other text.\n\nArticle:\nThe Premier League, the world’s richest competition, will share £1billion over three years with the rest of English football. The size of the hand-outs, which amounts to £50million per club, will go to five specific areas of the game. The deal is said to be unprecedented in global sport and amounts to an increase in excess of 40 per cent over the previous redistribution figure. The numbers were unanimously agreed at Thursday's summit of Premier League clubs — the first meeting since the £5billion domestic TV rights deal. Sharing the bonanza so quickly will go some way to countering the Premier League’s ‘greed is good’ image. Premier League CEO Richard Scudamore says the top flight is'sharing in the success of English football' Premier League clubs agreed on Thursday to make a £1bn contribution to the rest of English football. Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore said: ‘You can’t find me another sport that is committed to this level of sharing. You can use other fancy words like redistribution but this is sharing. It’s sharing in the success of English football.’ The targeted investments are in grass-roots facilities, participation, fan engagement, solidarity payments to the lower leagues and supporting disadvantaged groups. They include all clubs committing to adopting the living wage (£9.15 per hour in London and £7.85 outside London) for full-time employees by the start of the 2016-17 season. The clubs voted in favour despite being told that title sponsors Barclays will not be renewing their endorsement when their current contract expires at the end of next season. But the loss of that £120m deal — sure to be replaced at a higher price — didn’t stop clubs committing £50m each to the PL’s good causes. Ironically, around 50 fans were demonstrating outside the meeting in Piccadilly, London about the Premier league re-distributing their wealth. The only caveat is the result of the current Ofcom investigation into how the TV rights are sold and the monies raised from the international rights sales. Scudamore, who will become executive chairman in June, said: ‘These are unprecedented levels of redistribution in world sport, let alone football, which will deliver long-term progress for English football whether you are a fan, lower league club or involved in the grassroots. The summit meeting is the first since the new record £5bn TV rights deal was secured by the league. BT Sport and Sky Sports (above) took their share of Premier League fixtures in the bumper new deal. ‘I don’t think our clubs have ever made such an early stamp in the ground that says we are committed to what we’ve always done but actually extending and growing. ‘I’ve never seen them unanimously want to say “We want to make a statement. It’s a big statement to give away £1billion of our UK TV deal”. ‘We’ve had commercial success and we are going to share that success and we’ve done this at very short notice. Rarely do we get things through as quickly as this. ‘I do hope over time people will appreciate what we do. Those who know most about us respect us the most. What we do in this space is hugely motivational to me — I absolutely believe in it to my core.’ Scudamore added: ‘I was hugely encouraged about the fact that I don’t think anybody in the room doubted this was the right thing to do. It was all about how it would work.’ About the living wage commitment, he said: ‘We absolutely get and the clubs absolutely get that if you are paying players X and X is a big number it does look a little incongruous if you are only paying your employees Y. ‘My only plea is that we have to be allowed to do this in our own time, We are only halfway through our sales process and we do have the big issue of Ofcom still sitting over us.’ However, acting so quickly in sharing their jackpot rights will certainly make it a lot more difficult for Ofcom to rule against their TV riches.\n\nSummary:",

She made her fortune when her career took off in the US and now comedienne Tracey Ullman is set to mark her UK comeback - with a six-episode of her sketch show on BBC1. Worth an estimated £75million, the mother-of-two is a far cry from the star who was introduced to the public in Three of a Kind and A Kick Up the EIghties. And thanks to The Tracey Ullman show, she became one of the few British acts to break the American market. Also a Hollywood actress, Miss Ullman said yesterday the BBC had transformed since her original stint at the Corporation. She said: ‘It’s a privilege to be doing this. I still feel as inspired to inhabit people as I did when I was six, standing on the windowsill in my mother’s bedroom, putting on a show. ‘The BBC has changed a bit since the last time I worked here, when it was all men in bow ties who had completed National Service. Now there are a lot more women. Great ones. 'The important things haven’t changed, though. The BBC still provides an environment that allows you to the freedom to create the best shows possible.’ Shane Allen, head of comedy at the BBC, called Miss Ullman’s return to BBC1 a ‘homecoming’ and said: ‘We’ve got Tracey Ullman returning to our screens to do what she does brilliantly – a multi-character sketch show. 'She’s won 7 Emmys for her work and she’s always been the one who got away for British comedy, a huge talent and it’s an enormous privilege to welcome her back to the BBC.’ A source at the BBC added: ‘Tracey is a huge talent who has the comedy world at her feet so for her to choose to come back to the BBC feels like a real coup for the corporation. Before heading across the Atlantic, she had built a career on the stage and then found fame on television among a generation of comics that included Lenny Henry, Rik Mayall, Robbie Coltrane and David Copperfield. But it was not enough for Miss Ullman, who headed to across the Atlantic to forge a new career. With The Tracey Ullman Show in the late 1980s, she became one of the few British acts to successfully break the American market and the first foreign-born female comedian to do so. The variety show not only won a string of top awards, including a Golden Globe, but also gave cartoon The Simpsons its first chance of television as a regular segment on the programme. She is now bringing the programme to the BBC as part of its new comedy line-up, announced yesterday. Other highlights include The Ronnie Barker Comedy Lecture, in which a big comedy name – yet to be announced – will discuss the role the art form has in a free society. Original:\xa0The Simpsons Family as they first appeared on the Tracey Ullman Show. Other BBC stalwarts will be making their usual appearances. A programme has been commissioned to mark the 25-year partnership of Harry Enfield, 53, and Paul Whitehouse, 56, and there will also be new offerings from Rory Bremner, 53, and Death in Paradise star Ben Miller, 49. As well as acting, Miss Ullman has appeared in Hollywood films such as The Corpse Bride and Into the Woods, and made her fortune flipping high-value homes in Los Angeles with her husband, Allan McKeown. The Award-winning producer of his wife’s show Tracey Takes On…, Mr McKeown died on Christmas Eve 2013 at the age of 67 from prostate cancer, three days before the couple’s thirtieth wedding anniversary. They had two children, Johnny McKeown, 26, who has followed in his mother’s footsteps to become an actor, and Mabel, 28, who is a manager at charity International Medical Corps and previously worked for Labour’s deputy leader Harriet Harman. She unsuccessful sought selection as the Labour candidate for the Neath constituency, in Wales, at this year’s general election. Early days: Tracey Ullman (middle) with comedian David Copperfield (left) and Lenny Henry with their awards for television programme 'Three of a kind' at the Variety club awards in 1984. This political inclination towards left-wing politics runs in the family as Miss Ullman is a known Labour supporter and is friends with the party’s former leader Neil Kinnock. While she has gone on to such stellar success, Miss Ullman did not have an easy start to life. She was born in Slough in 1959, to a middle class family. She was the youngest of two daughter born to Polish émigré Anthony Ullman. Mr Ullman was a key figure in the local Eastern European community and sold suits made by his English seamstress wife Dorin. She lost her father at the age of six when he collapsed and died from a heart attack while reading her a bedtime story. His death saw the family’s fortunes change and they moved to Hackbridge, southwest London, where her mother was forced to work a series of odd-jobs to make ends meet. She has previously said of the loss: ‘After he died, our fortunes came and went because Mum couldn’t speak Polish and had to give up the business. 'When I meet other girls who lost their fathers when they were young, I really relate to them. You become independent quickly; I could cope with anything because of that terrible loss.’ Despite struggling for money, Miss Ullman has said her mother would only ever refer to the family as middle class out of a sense of pride and because ‘we had money at one time.’ Mrs Ullman then had an unhappy second marriage and, after it ended, the family moved around the country several times. Miss Ullman always had dreams of performing and would put on shows for her mother with her sister Patti. At 13, she visited a clairvoyant who predicted she would find fame in America. She won a scholarship to respected stage school Italia Conti and, aged 16, she landed her first job dancing in Berlin. The following year she was performing in a show in Blackpool alongside Les Dawson. She said: ‘He was terrific. He had a great brain and he liked smart women. I used to drink scotch and smoke cigarettes with him in his dressing room.'And he was the first person to say to me: `You know, you’re very funny. You should do more comedy. You won’t be a dancer for ever.’ I remember taking that very seriously.’ She went on to have a short-lived career as a pop singer before marrying Mr McKeown, 15 years her senior, in 1983. A successful producer with interests in Los Angeles as well as London, They moved into Steven Spielberg’s old house in California when she was pregnant with Mabel and she was happy to try her hand at comedy in America.\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[],

Const. Victor Kwong said tips from the public helped them identify the two men in their 20s responsible for building the underground chamber near a Pan Am Games venue. News of the tunnel\'s discovery set off a social media frenzy, with theories of its purpose ranging from zombie hideouts to affordable housing. Kwong said the two men just wanted to have fun and there was never any danger to public safety. Scroll down for video. Mystery: Authorities said this image reveals the tunnel\'s entrance, as well as a sump pump water hose and an electric extension cord. Good times: Toronto police said the tunnel, seen following an excavation, was built for fun. Puzzle:\xa0News of the tunnel\'s discovery set off a social media frenzy, with theories of its purpose ranging from zombie hideouts to affordable housing. Const. Victor Kwong said the two men just wanted to have fun and there was never any danger to public safety. \'It was a place for them to hang out. They started out as goal to make a cool place and that\'s what they did,\' Kwong said. He said investigators checked out their explanation and the case is now closed. He said the men will not be charged, though they could face a fine. The bunker, discovered in January by a conservation officer in a densely wooded area, is located 25 meters (27 yards) from the fence of the Rexall Centre, which is to host tennis events for the Pan Am Games. Inside, police said they found beverage containers, plywood wall supports, a generator and a sump pump. The chamber was almost 2 meters (2 yards) high, 86 centimeters (34 inches) wide and 10 meters (33 feet) long. Kwong said police are not releasing the men\'s names, or any further details since the case is not a criminal investigation. Kwong said the men are not believed to be survivalists, adding they just \'wanted to dig a tunnel.\' He said they were not ex-miners or engineers. Investigation: Kwong said police are not releasing the names of the men who built the tunnel, or any further details since the case is not a criminal investigation. Discreet: Toronto police say this is what was used to cover the tunnel. Prepping: A compressor (left) and a generator pit (right) were also at the tunnel site in Toronto. \'The minute they were found they were apologetic,\' Kwong said. He said there is no connection to this summer\'s Pan Am Games, or to York University, which is also near the site where the tunnel was found. \'With the enormous interest generated by the media, police received information on Friday, February 27, 2015, which enabled investigators to identify two men,\' Toronto police said in a Tuesday news release. It continued \'The two men told investigators they built the tunnel for personal reasons. Investigators have verified their account and are satisfied there was neither criminal intent nor any threat to the people or city of Toronto. The investigation is concluded.\' Speaking to CBC News, Kwong said \'So, when we say "personal reasons," what we basically mean is that it was not for any type of nefarious, nothing in terms of, you know, ritual or anything like that. \'It is simply two guys who just wanted to dig a cave. And that really is the - I mean, it sounds too simplified, but that really is what our investigation has led to.\' He also told the news outlet \'Although we\'re not getting into details about them, what we can say is that they were not related to Rexall. Not related to Pan Am. Nor were they related to York University. \'These are just two men who decided that they wanted to embark upon this adventure.\' Toronto police announced the discovery of the tunnel on Feb. 24 after weeks of surveillance didn\'t turn up anything. Safety: Kwong said the tunnel has no connection to this summer\'s Pan Am Games, or to York University, which is also near the site where the tunnel was found. Identities: Kwong said the men are not believed to be survivalists, adding they just \'wanted to dig a tunnel.\' Toronto police say this image reveals what was used to keep the generator pit hidden from view. Curious: Investigators also recovered this rosary necklace and poppy flower.\n\nSummary:', params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0,

Please output the summary only, without any other text.\n\nArticle:\nOne of Britons' favourite places to visit in North Africa has been named the world's top destination by TripAdvisor users. With its desert landscape and bustling souks, Marrakech came out on top in the website's annual Travellers' Choice Awards for the first time. It finished ahead of Siem Reap in Cambodia and Istanbul in Turkey, which finished second and third, respectively. London missed out on a spot in the top five, finishing sixth. Scroll down for video. Marrakech came out on top in TripAdvisor's annual Travellers' Choice Awards for the first time. Hanoi, Vietnam and Prague, Czech Republic rounded out the top five. Some results were surprising, as New York failed to make the top ten for the second year in a row. Traditional holiday destinations in North America and Western Europe were trumped by cities or resorts in Africa, Asia and Eastern Europe. London ranked sixth in TripAdvisor's study, behind Hanoi, Vietnam and Prague, Czech Republic. 1. Marrakech - £60.272. 2. Siem Reap - £37.71. 3. Istanbul - £71.66. 4. Hanoi - £27.06. 5. Prague - £57.83. 6. London - £162.25. 7. Rome - £86.72. 8. Buenos Aires - £63.21. 9. Paris - £114.34. 10. Cape Town - £77.21. The awards from the world's largest travel review site judge destinations on a worldwide scale, in Europe and in the UK. Siem Reap in Cambodia leaped in the ratings from last year, gaining seven places to take second place. In fourth place, Hanoi offered the cheapest hotel rooms at under £30 a night. Last year's runner-up, Rome,  slipped five places to take seventh place. London similarly slipped from third to sixth place, although it is only one of three cities which have secured a top ten spot five years in a row. 'The competition among global tourist destinations has never been tougher,' said TripAdvisor spokesperson James Kay. 'A combination of low average booking rates and fantastic traveller reviews on TripAdvisor has helped Asian, African and Eastern European destinations steal a march on old favourites like New York and Rome.' New York, one of the world's most visited cities, failed to crack the top ten for the second year in a row. Steve Jackson, TripAdvisor's top contributor of photos in 2014, said: 'Marrakech is one of those cities that should be on everyone's bucket list. 'It's a fantastic city to explore, rich in history and culture, and between the sea of street activity, bright colours and striking sunsets, it is a truly intoxicating experience.' In the UK it was the northern cities that took the top spots, taking eight of the ten best rated UK destinations. Blackpool, famed for its tower and beach, had the cheapest hotel room rate out of the UK's top destinations. Despite London being named the best UK city, Llandudno and Torquay beat rivals Liverpool, Belfast and York. Lake District's Keswick featured in the top ten for the first time beating Glasgow. Blackpool, in sixth place, had the cheapest hotel room rate in the top ten at £76.21, less than half the rate for a similar room in London.\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=128, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=False, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: [128000, 9370, 5730, 553, 279, 2768, 3754, 4652, 304, 220, 4386, 11460, 13, 5321, 2612, 279, 12399, 1193, 11, 2085, 904, 1023, 1495, 382, 17064, 512, 4054, 315, 5567, 2439, 6, 19214, 7634, 311, 4034, 304, 4892, 10384, 706, 1027, 7086, 279, 1917, 596, 1948, 9284, 555, 85066, 3932, 13, 3161, 1202, 24521, 18921, 323, 90256, 5945, 2857, 11, 69698, 731, 331, 3782, 704, 389, 1948, 304, 279, 3997, 596, 9974, 43359, 25812, 6, 28206, 23488, 369, 279, 1176, 892, 13, 1102, 8220, 8469, 315, 12095, 336, 1050, 391, 304, 62138, 323, 54468, 304, 17442, 11, 902, 8220, 2132, 323, 4948, 11, 15947, 13, 7295, 13942, 704, 389, 264, 7858, 304, 279, 1948, 4330, 11, 25270, 26084, 13, 23198, 1523, 369, 2835, 13, 69698, 731, 331, 3782, 704, 389, 1948, 304, 85066, 596, 9974, 43359, 25812, 6, 28206, 23488, 369, 279, 1176, 892, 13, 473, 73803, 11, 23315, 323, 68389, 11, 34250, 5545, 18460, 704, 279, 1948, 4330, 13, 4427, 3135, 1051, 15206, 11, 439, 1561, 4356, 4745, 311, 1304, 279, 1948, 5899, 369, 279, 2132, 1060, 304, 264, 2872, 13, 46560, 13560, 34205, 304, 4892, 5270, 323, 11104, 4606, 1051, 39155, 291, 555, 9919, 477, 61545, 304, 10384, 11, 13936, 323, 18516, 4606, 13, 7295, 21682, 26084, 304, 85066, 596, 4007, 11, 4920, 473, 73803, 11, 23315, 323, 68389, 11, 34250, 5545, 13, 220, 16, 13, 69698, 731, 331, 482, 7083, 1399, 13, 15741, 13, 220, 17, 13, 12095, 336, 1050, 391, 482, 7083, 1806, 13, 6028, 13, 220, 18, 13, 54468, 482, 7083, 6028, 13, 2287, 13, 220, 19, 13, 473, 73803, 482, 7083, 1544, 13, 2705, 13, 220, 20, 13, 68389, 482, 7083, 3226, 13, 6069, 13, 220, 21, 13, 7295, 482, 7083, 10674, 13, 914, 13, 220, 22, 13, 22463, 482, 7083, 4218, 13, 5332, 13, 220, 23, 13, 69173, 65717, 482, 7083, 5495, 13, 1691, 13, 220, 24, 13, 12366, 482, 7083, 8011, 13, 1958, 13, 220, 605, 13, 29715, 14298, 482, 7083, 2813, 13, 1691, 13, 578, 23146, 505, 279, 1917, 596, 7928, 5944, 3477, 2816, 11913, 34205, 389, 264, 15603, 5569, 11, 304, 4606, 323, 304, 279, 6560, 13, 12095, 336, 1050, 391, 304, 62138, 514, 10395, 304, 279, 18594, 505, 1566, 1060, 11, 30240, 8254, 7634, 311, 1935, 2132, 2035, 13, 763, 11999, 2035, 11, 473, 73803, 9076, 279, 43149, 9689, 12295, 520, 1234, 7083, 966, 264, 3814, 13, 8155, 1060, 596, 23055, 5352, 11, 22463, 11, 220, 43578, 4330, 7634, 311, 1935, 31487, 2035, 13, 7295, 30293, 43578, 505, 4948, 311, 26084, 2035, 11, 8051, 433, 374, 1193, 832, 315, 2380, 9919, 902, 617, 27528, 264, 1948, 5899, 7858, 4330, 1667, 304, 264, 2872, 13, 364, 791, 10937, 4315, 3728, 31070, 34205, 706, 2646, 1027, 49331, 2965, 1071, 85066, 29003, 7957, 31245, 13, 364, 32, 10824, 315, 3428, 5578, 22615, 7969, 323, 14964, 86294, 8544, 389, 85066, 706, 9087, 14875, 11, 11904, 323, 18516, 7665, 34205, 27669, 264, 15572, 389, 2362, 58034, 1093, 1561, 4356, 323, 22463, 3238, 1561, 4356, 11, 832, 315, 279, 1917, 596, 1455, 12263, 9919, 11, 4745, 311, 17944, 279, 1948, 5899, 369, 279, 2132, 1060, 304, 264, 2872, 13, 14129, 13972, 11, 85066, 596, 1948, 26373, 315, 7397, 304, 220, 679, 19, 11, 1071, 25, 364, 44, 1138, 731, 331, 374, 832, 315, 1884, 9919, 430, 1288, 387, 389, 5127, 596, 15994, 1160, 13, 364, 2181, 596, 264, 14964, 3363, 311, 13488, 11, 9257, 304, 3925, 323, 7829, 11, 323, 1990, 279, 9581, 315, 8761, 5820, 11, 10107, 27230, 323, 21933, 7160, 5022, 11, 433, 374, 264, 9615, 72815, 1113, 3217, 3238, 763, 279, 6560, 433, 574, 279, 18671, 9919, 430, 3952, 279, 1948, 19300, 11, 4737, 8223, 315, 279, 5899, 1888, 22359, 6560, 34205, 13, 5348, 10497, 11, 61403, 369, 1202, 21970, 323, 11573, 11, 1047, 279, 43149, 9689, 3130, 4478, 704, 315, 279, 6560, 596, 1948, 34205, 13, 18185, 7295, 1694, 7086, 279, 1888, 6560, 3363, 11, 445, 1974, 664, 2201, 323, 8611, 447, 352, 9567, 35938, 25715, 11, 55339, 323, 4356, 13, 11940, 11182, 596, 84077, 21878, 15109, 304, 279, 1948, 5899, 369, 279, 1176, 892, 27242, 43997, 13, 5348, 10497, 11, 304, 26084, 2035, 11, 1047, 279, 43149, 9689, 3130, 4478, 304, 279, 1948, 5899, 520, 7083, 4767, 13, 1691, 11, 2753, 1109, 4376, 279, 4478, 369, 264, 4528, 3130, 304, 7295, 382, 19791, 25], prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

Please output the summary only, without any other text.\n\nArticle:\nIt's one of India's most colourful festivals and when Princess Beatrice was invited to get involved during a London cocktail party thrown to celebrate it, she just couldn't resist getting stuck in. Luckily for Beatrice, that meant bindi accessories inspired by the sub-continent rather than the paint-throwing that characterises the real thing. The 26-year-old was back on the fashion circuit for the second time in less than seven days, having stepped out for the gala launch of the Alexander McQueen Savage Beauty retrospective last week. Bright spark: Princess Beatrice got into the spirit of the event with a set of bright green bindis. Looking good: Beatrice looked lovely in an emerald-green dress with a striking sequinned bodice. On that occasion, Beatrice, who is recently returned from the US where she went back to school to study a brief course in finance, opted for a daring thigh-high gown. This time, the Princess, who was attending a party thrown by London-based Indian designer Saloni Lodha, opted for a striking emerald-green dress and a forehead decorated with bindis. Ms Lodha, who grew up in Mumbai but has also lived in Seoul and Hong Kong, launched her eponymous label in 2008 and counts Samantha Cameron and Michelle Obama among her fans. Now stocked at Net-a-Porter and Matches among others, she is famous for her love of colourful print and flatteringly feminine designs. But Ms Lodha wasn't the only print fan at the party, with fellow designer, Greek-born Mary Katrantzou, also in attendance. All smiles: Beatrice posed with Ms Lodha who was wearing one of her own eye-catching designs. Fashion fan: Beatrice has become a familiar face on the London fashion party circuit of late. Support: Last week, she turned out for the opening of the V&A's Savage Beauty McQueen retrospective. Ms Katrantzou has long championed the digital print and regularly shows eye-wateringly colourful designs at London Fashion Week. Beatrice, who also attended London Fashion Week, has become a familiar face on London's party circuit of late. A week before the McQueen Savage Beauty retrospective, the 26-year-old was pictured rubbing shoulders with actor Martin Sheen at another VIP event. Joined by Branson clan, Beatrice and Mr Sheen held court at a gala dinner at the Bulgari Hotel held in aid of We Day.

Please output the summary only, without any other text.\n\nArticle:\nA new biography makes the startling claim that\xa0Walt Disney CEO Bob Iger purposely kept Steve Jobs' cancer a secret despite learning that he was very sick hours before his company bought the animation studio. Iger learned that Job's cancer had returned half an hour before Disney announced it was buying Jobs' Pixar studio in 2006. But in an extraordinary show of faith the CEO of Disney decided to keep the Apple co-founder's condition a secret for three years, according to a new biography of Jobs obtained by\xa0Bloomberg. Secret pact: Steve Jobs, right, talks with Walt Disney Company CEO Bob Iger at an Apple media event in 2006, a new book\xa0makes the startling claim that  Iger purposely kept Jobs' cancer a secret despite learning that he was very sick hours before buying Jobs' Pixar. Confession: On the day of the deal in 2006, the pair found a secluded spot on the Pixar campus in Emeryville, California, pictured, where Jobs put his arm around Iger's shoulder and revealed that his cancer was back. In the book titled 'Becoming Steve Jobs' by Brent Schlender and Rick Tetzeli, due to be published on March 24, details emerged of the business pact that made\xa0Jobs' Disney's largest shareholder. Iger reasoned that Disney's $7 billion deal for Pixar was not about Jobs or his medical condition so it did not need to be disclosed, according to the biography. The book details how Iger told Jobs: 'You're our largest shareholder, but I don't think that makes this matter. You're not material to this deal. We're buying Pixar, we're not buying you.' Jobs, the prolific co-founder of Apple, was first diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2003. He underwent surgery to remove it in 2004, but the tumor returned and he had a liver transplant in 2009. The book details how on\xa0January 24, 2006, the proposed day of the deal, Iger was at Pixar's headquarters for the ceremony when Jobs asked to go for a private walk. As the pair found a secluded spot on the campus in Emeryville, California, Jobs put his arm around Iger's shoulder and revealed that his cancer was back. Secret: Iger, right, reasoned that the $7 billion deal was on the value of Pixar, not Jobs, left, or his medical condition, so, after consulting a lawyer, the deal went ahead. Pixar deal: Steve Jobs, famous founder of Apple Computer, sits beneath the symbol of another of his ventures, Pixar Animation Studios, on\xa0January 24, 2006, Disney bought the firm for $7 million, despite Job's cancer. Marriage: Steve Jobs and his wife, Laurene Powell, are pictured at the Pixar Exhibit Launch 2005. The couple married in 1991, and she, along with his doctor, were the only ones who knew  he had cancer at first. Pixar: Ralph J. Guggenheim (right), an executive at Pixar Animation Studios, talks with an animator in the office. The firm has become a powerhouse animation studio for Disney, responsible for producing hits like Toy Story. Iger said Job's confided: 'Frankly, they tell me I've got a 50-50 chance of living five years.' Iger added: 'So I look at my watch and we've got 30 minutes. In 30 minutes, we're going to make this announcement. We've got television crews, we've got the board votes, we've got investment bankers. Pixar is an American computer animation film studio based in Emeryville, California. It is best known for its CGI-animated feature films and has produced fourteen feature films, beginning with Toy Story in 1995. The firm, established in February 1986, has become a powerhouse animation studio for Disney, responsible for hits like\xa0Ratatouille, WALL-E, Up, Brave and Monsters, Inc. Additionally, the studio has earned 15 Academy Awards, seven Golden Globe Awards, and eleven Grammy Awards. 'The wheels are turning.\xa0And I'm thinking, 'We're in this post Sarbanes-Oxley world, and Enron and fiduciary responsibility, and he is going to be our largest shareholder and I'm now being asked to bury a secret.' Up until that point, only Jobs' wife Lauren Powell and his doctor knew he had cancer. According to excerpts from the book, after Jobs' revelation, Iger asked Alan Braverman, Disney's top lawyer for advice. Braverman quickly agreed that Disney could go ahead with the acquisition.\xa0So the deal was done. However, just three years later, Jobs took a medical leave of absence. Iger said: 'In that three-year period, I always knew exactly what was going on with Steve medically. He and I would talk all the time, and since I kept things secret he confided in me.' The book, which will be published on Tuesday, paints a more sympathetic picture than the 2011 biography by Walter Isaacson, which focused on  Jobs' messy personal life and tough temperament. The Apple co-founder died in October 2011.\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0,

Please output the summary only, without any other text.\n\nArticle:\nSeveral business owners in Austin were horrified this week to find large stickers bearing the message 'Exclusively for white people' affixed to their storefronts. As thousands partied and pitched new technologies at the SXSW festival, staff at an East Austin bakery were wondering who would want to announce to their customers 'Maximum of 5 colored customers/colored BOH staff accepted.' 'As a multiracial family with a multiracial staff, there's nothing funny about this … It's sick,' Olivia Guerra O'Neal, owner of Sugar Mama's Bakeshop, told KXAN. 'We are disgusted by this act of vandalism and cowardice.' Shocking: These stickers appeared overnight between Tuesday and Wednesday on the storefronts of at least six Austin, Texas businesses. The stickers also appeared during the night between Tuesday and Wednesday on a Mexican restaurant, clothing store, bicycle shop and others. The glossy stickers also feature what looks like an official City of Austin seal and the message'sponsored by the City of Austin Contemporary Partition and Restoration Program.' But Austin Mayor Steve Adler wants the world to know his city had absolutely nothing to do with the stickers. 'This is an appalling and offensive display of ignorance in our city. Austin condemns this type of hurtful behavior. Our city is a place where respect for all people is a part of our spirit and soul. We will keep it that way,' Adler said in a statement. While  Austin appears to agree the stickers are wholly inappropriate, no one is sure what their point is. Video from KEYE-TV. 'Some jokes are not funny': Business owners can't agree on what the stickers mean--is it racist or a message about gentrification?--but all say they're inappropriate. 'Appalling and offensive display of ignorance': The stickers said they were sponsored by Austin's 'Contemporary Partition and Restoration Program' along with an official-looking city seal, which led the mayor to condemn the confusing prank. Some say the creator is attempting to make a statement. 'People are saying that this may be an attempt at satire, or a statement about gentrification,” said O'Neal said. Others say it could be an offensive joke. 'Some jokes are not funny,' Texas House of Representatives member Dawnna Duke wrote in a Facebook post along with a photo of a sticker affixed to clothing store Rare Trends. 'If this is a joke at all, it is tasteless...I will be damned if this will occur in my House District … in this historical black community or any community.' Regardless of its intent, Sugar Mama's employees have labeled it a hate crime.

And there was even support in between, as airline Qantas provided special headrests for the flight with the slogan '#GoGold'. Australia celebrate taking a wicket during their 95-run win over India on Thursday in the World Cup semi final. Fast bowler Mitchell Johnson posted a picture of all-rounder James Faulkner from the plane to his Instagram account. Johnson wrote: 'On our way to melb.

The document, issued by\xa0the National Transportation Safety Board, describes how the 72-year-old actor reported an engine failure shortly after taking off from Santa Monica  Airport last Thursday. He then alerted air traffic controllers and turned back toward the airport, the report states. However, as he did so, the aircraft struck the top of a tall tree. Seconds later, it crashed to the ground. The plane - which\xa0came to rest around 800 feet from the approach end of a runway at the airport -sustained'substantial damage to both wings and the fuselage' in the smash,  the document states. Scroll down for video. Bloodied: A preliminary report detailing actor Harrison Ford's actions just seconds before he crash-landed his 1940s vintage plane on to a California golf course was today released by federal transport officials. Above, Ford is pictured\xa0being carried away from Penmar Golf Course in Venice, Los Angeles, on a stretcher last Thursday. Wrecked: The document, issued by the NTSB, describes how the 72-year-old actor reported an engine failure shortly after taking off from Santa Monica Airport last Thursday. Above, Ford's wrecked plane after the crash. Document: Ford then alerted air traffic controllers and turned back toward the airport, the report (pictured) states. However, as he did so, the aircraft struck the top of a tall tree. Seconds later, it crashed to the ground. Meanwhile, Ford, who played Han Solo in the original Star Wars series, suffered serious injuries, including a fractured pelvis and a broken ankle. However, he is expected to make a full recovery. The preliminary report explains how the actor was flying his World War II-era training plane under visual flight rules on the day of the crash. This meant he did not need to submit a flight plan. It added that 'visual meteorological conditions prevailed', but that following the aircraft's takeoff from runway 21, 'the pilot advised of an engine failure and requested an immediate return to the airport'. Ford 'initiated a left turn back towards the airport; the airplane subsequently struck the top of a tall tree prior to impacting the ground in an open area of a golf course,' the report states. It concludes: 'The airplane was recovered to a secure location for further examination.' The report was constructed 'using data from various sources' after 'a significant amount of investigative work'. It does not detail why Ford's engine might have failed, causing him to plummet to the ground. A final report is expected to be released when NTSB officials have finished their inquiry into the crash. Devoted: Ford suffered serious injuries in the crash, including a fractured pelvis and a broken ankle. Above, his wife, Calista Flockhart, is seen on Tuesday driving home from hospital after spending the entire day with him. Recovery: Ford is being treated at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center (pictured) in Los Angeles, California. Last week, dramatic pictures emerged showing Ford being carried away from Penmar Golf Course in Venice, Los Angeles, on a stretcher, his face covered in blood and his neck strapped into a brace. First responders were also pictured wrapping bandages around his head.\xa0'He was stunned a bit,' spinal surgeon Sanjay Khurana, who was playing golf at the course at the time, told ABC News. He added: 'He was moaning and in pain. It was obvious by his face, it was Harrison Ford. I'm old enough, or young enough, to have watched all his 'Star Wars' films. So, it was obvious.' A video also emerged showing horrified golfers gaping open-mouthed at the sky before running out of the way as Ford deliberately steered his 1942 Ryan Aeronautical ST3KR into the ground. Investigators at the scene: The preliminary report explains how the actor was flying his World War II-era training plane under visual flight rules on the day of the crash, meaning he did not need to submit a flight plan. Taken away: It added that 'visual meteorological conditions prevailed', but that following the aircraft's takeoff from runway 21, 'the pilot advised of an engine failure and requested an immediate return to the airport' In a tweet late Thursday, Ford's son, Ben, said his famous father was 'battered, but OK.' Ford, an aviation enthusiast with years of flying under his belt, remains in hospital recovering from the crash. His wife, Calista Flockhart has stayed close to his side. The 50-year-old actress emerged on Friday night appearing tired and emotionally drained following a bedside vigil that lasted several hours. Flockhart was seen at the wheel of a black Lexus pulling out of the hospital parking garage with an older male companion. The former Ally McBeal star looked like she hadn't slept in a while. Her face was make-up free, while her eyes were dark-circled and bleary from possible crying. Her light brown hair hung limply around her face and her manner of dress appeared simple and casual. Couple: Earlier this week, it was said Flockhart is strongly urging her husband (pictured with her in January) to call it quits on his passion for flying and stay grounded because he might not be so fortunate next time. Avid flier: In a tweet late Thursday, Ford's son, Ben, said his famous father (pictured in 2001) was 'battered, but OK.' Ford, an aviation enthusiast with years of flying under his belt, is in hospital recovering from the crash. Earlier this week, it was claimed that Flockhart is strongly urging her husband to call it quits on his passion for flying and stay grounded because he might not be so fortunate next time. 'Calista is devastated. Thank goodness Harrison is OK but it could have been much, much worse,' her friend told\xa0The Mirror. 'It is a worry for her and his children that he has this dangerous hobby.' They added: 'Whether or not he will pilot a plane again remains to be seen but everyone around him certainly hopes he will take a break – or give it up for ever. It is \xadobviously a huge worry.' Flockhart is not the only one voicing her concerns for the screen legend. Star Wars co-star Carrie Fisher has also urged him to 'take a break' following his plane crash and take it easy, it is said. Film star: Flockhart is not the only one voicing her concerns for the screen legend. Ford's Star Wars co-star Carrie Fisher (pictured, center, as Princess Leia) has also urged the actor (left, as Han Solo) to 'take a break' Addressing Ford, who also starred as Indiana Jones, she told\xa0PEOPLE\xa0magazine: 'I know you have incredible bounce back, please take a bounce break for awhile. Can I drive next time?' Officials are currently inspecting the wreckage of the plane and  documents regarding its upkeep. 'The aircraft will be examined, the engine will be examined, the records of the aircraft will be examined and ultimately we'll submit a factual report,' Patrick Jones, of the NTSB said. He added: 'The final report probably will not be out for a year.'\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0,

The Prime Minister and Home Secretary Theresa May have become increasingly isolated in their determination to fix a new measure for bringing net migration under control. Mr Cameron is considering including two different targets in next month’s manifesto – including a specific target to slash net migration from outside the EU, which, unlike EU migration, ministers can fully control. Tory rift: Splits have opened in the upper ranks of the Tories over David Cameron’s plan to make a manifesto commitment to slash immigration - with the Prime Minister and Theresa May becoming increasingly isolated. He is also expected to re-state his commitment to sharply reducing overall net migration. But senior figures, including Chancellor George Osborne, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt and Communities Secretary Eric Pickles are understood to have voiced doubts about the idea. It follows the failure of Mr Cameron’s 2010 pledge to reduce overall net migration to the ‘tens of thousands’. Last week, the figure hit 300,000 – fuelled in large part by net migration from outside the EU of 190,000. Left-wing Tories outside of the Cabinet, who are in favour of a more relaxed borders policy, have seized on the figures as their moment to strike. They believe that, in the wake of this shuddering failure, it is easier to make the case for scrapping the target altogether. Yesterday, ex-Cabinet minister Kenneth Clarke said: ‘We will have to drop the target. It would not be possible to achieve it without damaging our economy quite severely. I’m afraid that the net migration target has proved to be a mistake.’ George Osborne is said to be among thoseto to have voiced doubts about the Prime Minister's idea. Baroness Warsi, a former Foreign Office minister, added: ‘If you set yourself unrealistic targets, you are setting yourself up to fail and, in the long term, turn the whole thing into a bigger issue by fuelling the perception that the Government can’t get a grip.’ But Mrs May is understood to believe that giving up on the target would be a huge error, not least because immigration still ranks in the top two concerns of voters. She recently resigned from the advisory board of a prominent Conservative think tank, called Bright Blue, which has publicly criticised the idea of a migration target. In a report, the right-of-centre organisation declared: ‘Putting an unreliable cap on net migration centre-stage has meant that other measures of competency have been missed and unnoticed.’ Its findings were given positive coverage in both the left-wing Guardian and Independent newspapers. One senior Government source, who supports the migration target, said: ‘This is the coming fight in the party – liberal metropolitans versus people who have lived in the real world.’ Illegal migrants run on October 29, 2014 behind a truck to try to board it in Calais last October. Over the past five years, Mrs May has introduced a series of policies to bring migration from outside the EU under control. These included a crackdown on bogus students and sham marriages. However, plans to go further – including the introduction of bonds for visitors – were blocked by the Treasury and the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills. Yesterday, immigration minister James Brokenshire, an ally of Mrs May, dropped strong hints a target would feature in the manifesto so that ‘people can measure’ progress made in cutting immigration. He said: ‘We do believe very strongly that net migration matters. Long-term figures will show you that net migration to this country over the long term has been in that below the 100,000 figure. So, we’re looking very carefully and we will be coming back so people can measure us on what success looks like in terms of our migration policy.’ He added: ‘The Prime Minister has said that we will come back and set out what you can measure us on – because that’s the key thing – on how we perform, on controlling our immigration system.’ The number of migrants in Calais has dropped by two thirds in recent weeks – suggesting many have managed to dodge border controls and reach Britain. The latest figures reveal that some 2,500 African, Asian and Eastern Europeans were in the French port town over the Christmas period but that number has now fallen to around 1,000. Break for the border: Migrants try to get into a lorry as it fills up with fuel near Calais. Last night it emerged that on one day in January alone a fire in the town caused chaos and allowed 300 migrants to sneak through the Channel Tunnel. A winter storm also caused major problems for border officials when a large section of fencing was blown down near the truck parking area. Hundreds more have succeeded in stowing away on trucks and vehicles from French ports such as Caen and Cherbourg where border controls are less stringent. In recent weeks Albanian people smugglers have moved their profitable operations down the coast from Calais and managed to load a number of migrants on to lorries at motorway rest areas. A recent head count in Calais revealed that only around 1,000 Africans, Asians and Eastern Europeans are now sleeping rough and in squats and at three open air camps in Calais. Shortly after Christmas when a similar survey was carried out the number was put at some 2,500. The French newspaper Nord Littoral reported over the weekend: ‘It is difficult to estimate the number of migrants present in Calais but one thing is certain – it has decreased significantly.’\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[],

Alpha Delta - depicted in the 1978 film Animal House - was suspended in October for various incidents including hazing, serving alcohol to minors and hosting unregistered parties. Officials are now extending that punishment over new allegations that members were burned last fall, with one student reportedly having the skin on his buttocks seared. They are also considering closing the 46-year-old club for good depending on the outcome of discussions. A pledge of Alpha Delta (above) reportedly agreed to be branded on his backside in the fall of 2014. Attorney George Ostler confirmed a small number of fraternity members voluntarily chose to get body brands, but the practice was never a condition of membership. He says no hazing occurred, no one was injured and members are cooperating fully with the college. News of the branding incident emerged this week via the website Gawker. A sophomore pledge of Alpha Delta reportedly agreed to be branded on his backside in the fall of 2014, according to a tipster. By agreeing to the branding, the pledge would theoretically be allowed to avoid'more drinking-intensive pledge activities'. When the pledge went home for winter break, he realized something was wrong with his brand and went to the doctor, Gawker reported. The\xa0fraternity at the Hanover, New Hampshire, school was famously depicted in the 1978 film Animal House. Dartmouth's sitting president Phil Hanlon (above) - class of 1977 - is a member of the Alpha Delta fraternity. He had to be hospitalized after it was determined the brand was infected. Medical personnel alerted the college, which is in Hanover, New Hampshire, and the school handed down a suspension. This is not the first time Alpha Delta has been linked to branding. A 1992\xa0Rolling Stone\xa0article reported that 'a few pledges were reportedly branded against their will this year'. Alpha Delta brothers did not deny that allegation at the time. The pledge whose brand became infected is now a brother in the fraternity. Earlier this year, Dartmouth College President Philip Hanlon - who was a member of Alpha Delta in the 1970s - announced a series of reforms to eliminate problems he said were 'hijacking' Dartmouth's future that included high-risk drinking, sexual assault and a lack of inclusiveness on campus. The college is banning hard liquor on campus, ending pledge or probationary periods for all student groups to reduce hazing, developing a mandatory sexual violence prevention program and creating new residential communities. Alpha Delta was initially founded by members of the Gamma Sigma Society but dissociated from its parent corporation and renamed itself The Alpha Delta Fraternity in 1969.\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=128, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=False, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: [128000, 9370, 5730, 553, 279, 2768, 3754, 4652, 304, 220, 4386, 11460, 13, 5321, 2612, 279, 12399, 1193, 11, 2085, 904, 1023, 1495, 382, 17064, 512, 32, 15779, 369, 264, 44081, 49197, 33780, 9304, 79396, 13487, 315, 44817, 502, 3697, 389, 872, 2547, 7863, 433, 311, 264, 1376, 315, 659, 82593, 1093, 60220, 477, 32894, 287, 13, 25737, 26002, 482, 44894, 304, 279, 220, 4468, 23, 4632, 21995, 4783, 482, 574, 22340, 304, 6664, 369, 5370, 24455, 2737, 305, 6795, 11, 13788, 13200, 311, 49640, 323, 20256, 653, 36009, 9875, 13, 64239, 527, 1457, 33459, 430, 25060, 927, 502, 18873, 430, 3697, 1051, 27724, 1566, 4498, 11, 449, 832, 5575, 18307, 3515, 279, 6930, 389, 813, 98035, 14895, 513, 1636, 13, 2435, 527, 1101, 13126, 15676, 279, 220, 2790, 4771, 6418, 6469, 369, 1695, 11911, 389, 279, 15632, 315, 20954, 13, 362, 36179, 315, 25737, 26002, 320, 49532, 8, 18307, 7378, 311, 387, 46935, 389, 813, 1203, 3002, 304, 279, 4498, 315, 220, 679, 19, 13, 18919, 10058, 66535, 1565, 11007, 264, 2678, 1396, 315, 79396, 3697, 54523, 14896, 311, 636, 2547, 16097, 11, 719, 279, 6725, 574, 2646, 264, 3044, 315, 16250, 13, 1283, 2795, 912, 305, 6795, 10222, 11, 912, 832, 574, 15902, 323, 3697, 527, 82589, 7373, 449, 279, 7926, 13, 5513, 315, 279, 44817, 10672, 22763, 420, 2046, 4669, 279, 3997, 86638, 7197, 13, 362, 51498, 36179, 315, 25737, 26002, 18307, 7378, 311, 387, 46935, 389, 813, 1203, 3002, 304, 279, 4498, 315, 220, 679, 19, 11, 4184, 311, 264, 11813, 3751, 13, 3296, 39427, 311, 279, 44817, 11, 279, 36179, 1053, 63234, 387, 5535, 311, 5766, 2846, 461, 16558, 88092, 36179, 7640, 4527, 3277, 279, 36179, 4024, 2162, 369, 12688, 1464, 11, 568, 15393, 2555, 574, 5076, 449, 813, 6883, 323, 4024, 311, 279, 10896, 11, 86638, 7197, 5068, 13, 578, 4194, 1658, 65143, 520, 279, 21296, 2017, 11, 1561, 31997, 11, 2978, 574, 51287, 44894, 304, 279, 220, 4468, 23, 4632, 21995, 4783, 13, 49197, 33780, 596, 11961, 4872, 7302, 21296, 12490, 320, 49532, 8, 482, 538, 315, 220, 4468, 22, 482, 374, 264, 4562, 315, 279, 25737, 26002, 79396, 13, 1283, 1047, 311, 387, 70340, 1306, 433, 574, 11075, 279, 6883, 574, 29374, 13, 13235, 17274, 67769, 279, 7926, 11, 902, 374, 304, 21296, 2017, 11, 1561, 31997, 11, 323, 279, 2978, 23415, 1523, 264, 25288, 13, 1115, 374, 539, 279, 1176, 892, 25737, 26002, 706, 1027, 10815, 311, 44817, 13, 362, 220, 2550, 17, 4194, 33455, 287, 14637, 4194, 7203, 5068, 430, 364, 64, 2478, 79118, 1051, 18307, 46935, 2403, 872, 690, 420, 1060, 4527, 25737, 26002, 20820, 1550, 539, 23973, 430, 58494, 520, 279, 892, 13, 578, 36179, 6832, 6883, 6244, 29374, 374, 1457, 264, 10868, 304, 279, 79396, 13, 47993, 420, 1060, 11, 49197, 33780, 9304, 4900, 26241, 21296, 12490, 482, 889, 574, 264, 4562, 315, 25737, 26002, 304, 279, 220, 4468, 15, 82, 482, 7376, 264, 4101, 315, 31343, 311, 22472, 5435, 568, 1071, 1051, 364, 71, 3251, 9162, 6, 49197, 33780, 596, 3938, 430, 5343, 1579, 46570, 16558, 11, 7392, 11965, 323, 264, 6996, 315, 45409, 13071, 389, 15679, 13, 578, 7926, 374, 49636, 2653, 45304, 389, 15679, 11, 13696, 36179, 477, 47027, 661, 18852, 369, 682, 5575, 5315, 311, 8108, 305, 6795, 11, 11469, 264, 23911, 7392, 9349, 27344, 2068, 323, 6968, 502, 20658, 10977, 13, 25737, 26002, 574, 15453, 18538, 555, 3697, 315, 279, 58782, 50637, 13581, 719, 91342, 660, 505, 1202, 2748, 27767, 323, 28379, 5196, 578, 25737, 26002, 2939, 65143, 304, 220, 5162, 24, 382, 19791, 25], prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

In an opinion column for the Los Angeles Times, the producer and "Wall Street" Oscar winner described an incident last summer in an unidentified country in "southern Europe." The older of his two children with actress Catherine Zeta-Jones, 14-year-old Dylan, came to his father in tears. "A man at the pool had started hurling insults at him," Douglas writes. It wasn\'t because of anything Dylan did, he continued: "Suddenly I had an awful realization of what might have caused the man\'s outrage: Dylan was wearing a Star of David." Douglas went to talk to the man -- "it was not a pleasant discussion," he writes -- and the incident has stayed in his mind. The 70-year-old actor, who was raised by a Jewish father, Kirk Douglas, and a non-Jewish mother, said he didn\'t identify as Jewish while growing up but noticed anti-Semitic remarks others made. "With little knowledge of what it meant to be a Jew, I found myself passionately defending the Jewish people. Now, half a century later, I have to defend my son," he writes. "Anti-Semitism, I\'ve seen, is like a disease that goes dormant, flaring up with the next political trigger." Douglas, who is also a United Nations messenger of peace, observes that anti-Semitism has been on the rise due to a number of factors, including income inequality, religious extremism and hatred of Israel. "Some find Jews to be a convenient scapegoat rather than looking at the real source of their problems," he says. He praises leaders such as Pope Francis, French Prime Minister Manuel Valls and Cardinal Timothy Dolan of New York for their efforts at reconciliation and community-building. But it isn\'t enough, he adds. "All of us" must fight anti-Semitism, he says. "If we confront anti-Semitism whenever we see it, if we combat it individually and as a society, and use whatever platform we have to denounce it, we can stop the spread of this madness," he writes. "My son is strong. He is fortunate to live in a country where anti-Semitism is rare. But now he too has learned of the dangers that he as a Jew must face. It\'s a lesson that I wish I didn\'t have to teach him, a lesson I hope he will never have to teach his children." Douglas received the 2015 Genesis Prize for "exceptional people whose values and achievements will inspire the next generation of Jews."\n\nSummary:', params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=128, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=False, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: [128000, 9370, 5730, 553, 279, 2768, 3754, 4652, 304, 220, 4386, 11460, 13, 5321, 2612, 279, 12399, 1193, 11, 2085, 904, 1023, 1495, 382, 17064, 512, 3100, 9944, 8, 26597, 31164, 6, 4538, 44458, 1047, 264, 1629, 3502, 449, 7294, 65910, 1198, 323, 279, 12360, 6944, 311, 656, 2555, 922, 433, 13, 763, 459, 9647, 3330, 369, 279, 9853, 12167, 8691, 11, 279, 17276, 323, 330, 33697, 6825, 1, 31797, 13946, 7633, 459, 10672, 1566, 7474, 304, 459, 65578, 3224, 304, 330, 105270, 6456, 4606, 1210, 578, 9191, 315, 813, 1403, 2911, 449, 24577, 42663, 1901, 1955, 12278, 3233, 11, 220, 975, 4771, 6418, 44458, 11, 3782, 311, 813, 7126, 304, 24014, 13, 330, 32, 893, 520, 279, 7463, 1047, 3940, 94831, 287, 68989, 520, 1461, 1359, 31164, 14238, 13, 1102, 5828, 956, 1606, 315, 4205, 44458, 1550, 11, 568, 8738, 25, 330, 98331, 358, 1047, 459, 25629, 49803, 315, 1148, 2643, 617, 9057, 279, 893, 596, 30229, 25, 44458, 574, 12512, 264, 7834, 315, 6941, 1210, 31164, 4024, 311, 3137, 311, 279, 893, 1198, 330, 275, 574, 539, 264, 24729, 10430, 1359, 568, 14238, 1198, 323, 279, 10672, 706, 20186, 304, 813, 4059, 13, 578, 220, 2031, 4771, 6418, 12360, 11, 889, 574, 9408, 555, 264, 13653, 7126, 11, 32446, 31164, 11, 323, 264, 2536, 12278, 66929, 6691, 11, 1071, 568, 3287, 956, 10765, 439, 13653, 1418, 7982, 709, 719, 14000, 7294, 74597, 24208, 3885, 1903, 13, 330, 2409, 2697, 6677, 315, 1148, 433, 8967, 311, 387, 264, 8117, 11, 358, 1766, 7182, 92925, 29269, 279, 13653, 1274, 13, 4800, 11, 4376, 264, 9478, 3010, 11, 358, 617, 311, 10726, 856, 4538, 1359, 568, 14238, 13, 330, 33749, 65910, 11, 358, 3077, 3970, 11, 374, 1093, 264, 8624, 430, 5900, 89460, 11, 1344, 3329, 709, 449, 279, 1828, 5054, 8346, 1210, 31164, 11, 889, 374, 1101, 264, 3723, 19687, 50596, 315, 9096, 11, 81299, 430, 7294, 65910, 706, 1027, 389, 279, 10205, 4245, 311, 264, 1396, 315, 9547, 11, 2737, 8070, 32305, 11, 10597, 70768, 323, 35242, 315, 6921, 13, 330, 8538, 1505, 17420, 311, 387, 264, 17125, 99113, 3427, 266, 4856, 1109, 3411, 520, 279, 1972, 2592, 315, 872, 5435, 1359, 568, 2795, 13, 1283, 87178, 6164, 1778, 439, 30460, 26184, 11, 8753, 12801, 9675, 44681, 650, 5700, 323, 47014, 45568, 25227, 276, 315, 1561, 4356, 369, 872, 9045, 520, 58755, 323, 4029, 52499, 13, 2030, 433, 4536, 956, 3403, 11, 568, 11621, 13, 330, 2460, 315, 603, 1, 2011, 4465, 7294, 65910, 11, 568, 2795, 13, 330, 2746, 584, 17302, 7294, 65910, 15716, 584, 1518, 433, 11, 422, 584, 12896, 433, 32399, 323, 439, 264, 8396, 11, 323, 1005, 8996, 5452, 584, 617, 311, 3453, 9933, 433, 11, 584, 649, 3009, 279, 9041, 315, 420, 52819, 1359, 568, 14238, 13, 330, 5159, 4538, 374, 3831, 13, 1283, 374, 40510, 311, 3974, 304, 264, 3224, 1405, 7294, 65910, 374, 9024, 13, 2030, 1457, 568, 2288, 706, 9687, 315, 279, 37064, 430, 568, 439, 264, 8117, 2011, 3663, 13, 1102, 596, 264, 18228, 430, 358, 6562, 358, 3287, 956, 617, 311, 4639, 1461, 11, 264, 18228, 358, 3987, 568, 690, 2646, 617, 311, 4639, 813, 2911, 1210, 31164, 4036, 279, 220, 679, 20, 41888, 32293, 369, 330, 7959, 278, 1274, 6832, 2819, 323, 33997, 690, 31740, 279, 1828, 9659, 315, 17420, 2266, 19791, 25], prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

Ova the top: Washington Fox 5's Bob Barnard got an earful from an African Moon Moth in a live spot at the Smithsonian's Museum of Natural History on Monday when the bug laid two eggs in his ear. Barnard was doing a story on Museum Week in DC when the moth laid eggs in his ear. He had no clue it had happened until after the broadcast. The moth had previously caused Barnard a bit of a tickle, which he at first appeared to believe was a bite. However, the insect zookeeper Barnard was interviewing informed him that African Moon Moths don't have mouths at all and are thus incapable of biting. Their plump, green larvae, the zookeeper explained, do all the eating. The moths then live off the fat stores once they become adults. 'That African Moon Moth on my ear on live TV laid two eggs! (Yuck),' Barnard tweeted Monday. Big and beautiful: The African Moon moth measures around 4 inches across with tail-like structures dangling majestically from its wings. The moth likely laid hundreds more eggs after the two he left behind on Barnard. Perhaps that sensation he thought was biting was actually the moth laying her eggs. Either way, the moth won't be around long enough to see if Barnard helps raise her young. The Moon Moth, unable to eat, lives only a handful of days. She does, however lay hundreds of eggs--just a few at a time--before she dies.\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=128, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=False, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: [128000, 9370, 5730, 553, 279, 2768, 3754, 4652, 304, 220, 4386, 11460, 13, 5321, 2612, 279, 12399, 1193, 11, 2085, 904, 1023, 1495, 382, 17064, 512, 32, 6652, 11, 423, 732, 13, 3754, 17543, 2751, 264, 1972, 2487, 1285, 2391, 264, 3974, 13195, 389, 7159, 994, 459, 39418, 27080, 2751, 779, 43535, 389, 813, 2487, 430, 568, 17551, 1403, 19335, 13, 13585, 220, 20, 596, 14596, 23229, 569, 574, 49927, 505, 4194, 1820, 89289, 596, 16730, 315, 18955, 11346, 369, 264, 3446, 389, 111658, 11768, 10563, 994, 264, 33552, 28935, 11904, 17781, 6178, 339, 51709, 27212, 389, 813, 2010, 13, 445, 867, 989, 9662, 28109, 11, 23229, 569, 8738, 449, 813, 13195, 13, 3277, 568, 574, 2884, 11, 568, 11352, 279, 279, 39418, 10077, 1047, 2163, 4920, 264, 8352, 13, 23198, 1523, 369, 2835, 13, 507, 6723, 279, 1948, 25, 6652, 13585, 220, 20, 596, 14596, 23229, 569, 2751, 459, 2487, 1285, 505, 459, 11904, 17781, 6178, 339, 304, 264, 3974, 7858, 520, 279, 89289, 596, 16730, 315, 18955, 11346, 389, 7159, 994, 279, 10077, 17551, 1403, 19335, 304, 813, 2487, 13, 23229, 569, 574, 3815, 264, 3446, 389, 16730, 10563, 304, 11162, 994, 279, 98178, 17551, 19335, 304, 813, 2487, 13, 1283, 1047, 912, 31089, 433, 1047, 7077, 3156, 1306, 279, 13195, 13, 578, 98178, 1047, 8767, 9057, 23229, 569, 264, 2766, 315, 264, 9525, 273, 11, 902, 568, 520, 1176, 9922, 311, 4510, 574, 264, 23556, 13, 4452, 11, 279, 27080, 42014, 19393, 23229, 569, 574, 65816, 16369, 1461, 430, 11904, 17781, 6178, 17323, 1541, 956, 617, 65609, 520, 682, 323, 527, 8617, 58271, 315, 68196, 13, 11205, 628, 1538, 11, 6307, 83861, 11, 279, 42014, 19393, 11497, 11, 656, 682, 279, 12459, 13, 578, 4647, 17323, 1243, 3974, 1022, 279, 8834, 10756, 3131, 814, 3719, 12884, 13, 364, 4897, 11904, 17781, 6178, 339, 389, 856, 2487, 389, 3974, 6007, 17551, 1403, 19335, 0, 320, 56, 1983, 23847, 23229, 569, 27045, 7159, 13, 6295, 323, 6366, 25, 578, 11904, 17781, 98178, 11193, 2212, 220, 19, 15271, 4028, 449, 9986, 12970, 14726, 92723, 24906, 478, 2740, 505, 1202, 27296, 13, 578, 98178, 4461, 17551, 11758, 810, 19335, 1306, 279, 1403, 568, 2163, 4920, 389, 23229, 569, 13, 19292, 430, 37392, 568, 3463, 574, 68196, 574, 3604, 279, 98178, 35744, 1077, 19335, 13, 21663, 1648, 11, 279, 98178, 2834, 956, 387, 2212, 1317, 3403, 311, 1518, 422, 23229, 569, 8779, 4933, 1077, 3995, 13, 578, 17781, 6178, 339, 11, 12153, 311, 8343, 11, 6439, 1193, 264, 23810, 315, 2919, 13, 3005, 1587, 11, 4869, 11203, 11758, 315, 19335, 313, 4345, 264, 2478, 520, 264, 892, 313, 15145, 1364, 8898, 382, 19791, 25], prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

Six crew members and 158 passengers were rescued from the American Airlines flight at Denver International Airport around midday yesterday. They had flown on Flight 445 from Charlotte, North Carolina, and had been taxiing to the gate for less than a minute when the captain ordered that the chutes be activated. Scroll down for video. More than 160 people were forced to exit American Airlines Flight 445 using its emergency slides after the cabin filled with smoke at Denver International Airport around midday on Wednesday. A bus took the passengers to the terminal, where they waited for two hours for their baggage. One minor injury was reported. It is thought the person slipped on ice. Passenger Andy Long said he noticed a smell like an emergency brake being left on in a running car and then saw the cabin fill with a light haze. He said: \'That\'s when they said "Everybody get out, get out, get out. Don\'t take your stuff."\' \'There was probably an appropriate amount of people being generally frustrated because their days got rained on.\' He wrote on Instagram after the incident that he can now tick using an emergency plane exit off his bucket list. Another passenger, Lindsay Geisler, said that passengers waited for 20 minutes for a bus. She added: \'It\'s been great to see how people rally together and help out one another when you get put into a situation like this.\' A bus took the passengers, who disembarked on to snow, to the terminal and they waited for two hours for their baggage. One passenger, Andy Long, said he noticed a smell like an emergency brake being left on in a running car and then saw the cabin fill with a light haze. Passengers waited by the plane until they were taken to the terminal. Men in suits, mothers with children and solo travellers were all forced to slide down one of the chutes. Greg Pixley, spokesman for the Denver Fire Department, said the smoke had been contained. \'There was smoke coming out of the wall. What caused it was contained to that one area,\' he told the Denver Post. A spokesman for the airport said there was no sign of a fire inside the plane. A spokesman for American Airlines said: \'While taxiing to the gate, the pilot was alerted to possible smoke in the cabin. The passengers and crew deplaned via the slides and are all in the terminal. \'We are in contact with the National Transportation Safety Board and the Federal Aviation Administration.\' A spokesman for the airport (above) said there was no sign of a fire inside the plane. Denver Fire Department said there was smoke coming out of the wall, but it was contained to one area.\n\nSummary:', params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=128, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=False, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: [128000, 9370, 5730, 553, 279, 2768, 3754, 4652, 304, 220, 4386, 11460, 13, 5321, 2612, 279, 12399, 1193, 11, 2085, 904, 1023, 1495, 382, 17064, 512, 7816, 1109, 220, 6330, 1274, 1051, 9770, 311, 4974, 264, 11277, 1701, 1202, 13147, 22245, 1306, 279, 13691, 10409, 449, 16603, 13, 19198, 13941, 3697, 323, 220, 11286, 22961, 1051, 45433, 505, 279, 3778, 35230, 11213, 520, 22898, 7327, 21348, 2212, 5209, 1316, 13985, 13, 2435, 1047, 53850, 389, 27675, 220, 19697, 505, 29473, 11, 4892, 13030, 11, 323, 1047, 1027, 33605, 287, 311, 279, 18618, 369, 2753, 1109, 264, 9568, 994, 279, 24862, 11713, 430, 279, 523, 2142, 387, 22756, 13, 23198, 1523, 369, 2835, 13, 4497, 1109, 220, 6330, 1274, 1051, 9770, 311, 4974, 3778, 35230, 27675, 220, 19697, 1701, 1202, 13147, 22245, 1306, 279, 13691, 10409, 449, 16603, 520, 22898, 7327, 21348, 2212, 5209, 1316, 389, 8079, 13, 362, 5951, 3952, 279, 22961, 311, 279, 15372, 11, 1405, 814, 30315, 369, 1403, 4207, 369, 872, 61649, 13, 3861, 9099, 11134, 574, 5068, 13, 1102, 374, 3463, 279, 1732, 43578, 389, 10054, 13, 68734, 25871, 5843, 1071, 568, 14000, 264, 22843, 1093, 459, 13147, 35718, 1694, 2163, 389, 304, 264, 4401, 1841, 323, 1243, 5602, 279, 13691, 5266, 449, 264, 3177, 90409, 13, 1283, 1071, 25, 364, 4897, 596, 994, 814, 1071, 330, 64952, 636, 704, 11, 636, 704, 11, 636, 704, 13, 4418, 956, 1935, 701, 6392, 35277, 364, 3947, 574, 4762, 459, 8475, 3392, 315, 1274, 1694, 8965, 33630, 1606, 872, 2919, 2751, 436, 2692, 389, 3238, 1283, 6267, 389, 14318, 1306, 279, 10672, 430, 568, 649, 1457, 9525, 1701, 459, 13147, 11277, 4974, 1022, 813, 15994, 1160, 13, 13596, 24023, 11, 63884, 4323, 285, 1565, 11, 1071, 430, 22961, 30315, 369, 220, 508, 4520, 369, 264, 5951, 13, 3005, 3779, 25, 364, 2181, 596, 1027, 2294, 311, 1518, 1268, 1274, 19768, 3871, 323, 1520, 704, 832, 2500, 994, 499, 636, 2231, 1139, 264, 6671, 1093, 420, 3238, 362, 5951, 3952, 279, 22961, 11, 889, 98644, 43161, 389, 311, 12056, 11, 311, 279, 15372, 323, 814, 30315, 369, 1403, 4207, 369, 872, 61649, 13, 3861, 24023, 11, 25871, 5843, 11, 1071, 568, 14000, 264, 22843, 1093, 459, 13147, 35718, 1694, 2163, 389, 304, 264, 4401, 1841, 323, 1243, 5602, 279, 13691, 5266, 449, 264, 3177, 90409, 13, 10175, 15232, 30315, 555, 279, 11277, 3156, 814, 1051, 4529, 311, 279, 15372, 13, 11258, 304, 29076, 11, 27698, 449, 2911, 323, 13839, 60068, 1051, 682, 9770, 311, 15332, 1523, 832, 315, 279, 523, 2142, 13, 16431, 50566, 3258, 11, 18367, 369, 279, 22898, 6785, 6011, 11, 1071, 279, 16603, 1047, 1027, 13282, 13, 364, 3947, 574, 16603, 5108, 704, 315, 279, 7147, 13, 3639, 9057, 433, 574, 13282, 311, 430, 832, 3158, 2965, 568, 3309, 279, 22898, 3962, 13, 362, 18367, 369, 279, 17149, 1071, 1070, 574, 912, 1879, 315, 264, 4027, 4871, 279, 11277, 13, 362, 18367, 369, 3778, 35230, 1071, 25, 364, 8142, 33605, 287, 311, 279, 18618, 11, 279, 18178, 574, 67769, 311, 3284, 16603, 304, 279, 13691, 13, 578, 22961, 323, 13941, 409, 10609, 291, 4669, 279, 22245, 323, 527, 682, 304, 279, 15372, 13, 364, 1687, 527, 304, 3729, 449, 279, 5165, 30978, 19220, 8925, 323, 279, 12411, 50047, 17128, 3238, 362, 18367, 369, 279, 17149, 320, 49532, 8, 1071, 1070, 574, 912, 1879, 315, 264, 4027, 4871, 279, 11277, 13, 22898, 6785, 6011, 1071, 1070, 574, 16603, 5108, 704, 315, 279, 7147, 11, 719, 433, 574, 13282, 311, 832, 3158, 382, 19791, 25], prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

Jonny Wilkinson, Lawrence Dallaglio and Jason Robinson and the coach who led them to that victory, Sportsmail columnist Sir Clive Woodward, will all be studio pundits for the tournament. England will host the competition, which starts on September 18, and the achievements of Woodward's side have set the benchmark for Stuart Lancaster's current squad as they look to win on home soil. Sir Clive Woodward (left) and Jonny Wilkinson (right) will be part of ITV's broadcasting team this summer. World Cup winners Jason Robinson and Lawrence Dallaglio will also be involved in the tournament. Wilkinson kicks the winning drop goal to give England victory in the final against Australia in 2003. Wilkinson unforgettably kicked the winning drop goal for the Red Rose against Australia in the final 12 years ago, while Robinson scored England's only try in the topsy-turvy 20-17 triumph after extra-time. George Gregan, who skippered Australia that day and also played in the victorious 1999 Wallabies side, is also part of ITV's line-up. Former Wales and Ireland skippers Gareth Thomas and Brian O'Driscoll will also be involved in the coverage, which will be led by presenter John Inverdale. Thomas, the first openly gay professional rugby player, reprises his broadcasting role from 2011 and O'Driscoll watches a World Cup from the sidelines for the first time since 1995 after retiring from the game last year. Gareth Thomas (left) and Brian O'Driscoll (right) will also be involved in ITV's coverage this summer. Former British and Irish Lions and Scotland coach Sir Ian McGeechan, victorious 1995 South Africa captain Francois Pienaar, New Zealand's Sean Fitzpatrick, Australia's Michael Lynagh and David Flatman complete the list of pundits. Niall Sloane, ITV director of sport, said: 'A Rugby World Cup hosted by England is a once in a generation event and it's our privilege as the exclusive television broadcaster to bring viewers the full impact of all the action and emotion throughout what we hope will be an unforgettable tournament. 'We believe we've assembled a world-class line up of rugby talent who, through their own expertise, experience and sheer passion for the game can help deliver the best possible coverage for those watching at home.' England will be hoping for glory at Twickenham at the 2015 World Cup.\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=128, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=False, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: [128000, 9370, 5730, 553, 279, 2768, 3754, 4652, 304, 220, 4386, 11460, 13, 5321, 2612, 279, 12399, 1193, 11, 2085, 904, 1023, 1495, 382, 17064, 512, 964, 53, 690, 35740, 635, 264, 1396, 315, 9635, 596, 220, 1049, 18, 4435, 11098, 27875, 23757, 439, 961, 315, 872, 49927, 1584, 5352, 369, 420, 1060, 596, 16520, 13, 12565, 3919, 95666, 11, 28574, 423, 543, 351, 26205, 323, 18984, 28280, 323, 279, 7395, 889, 6197, 1124, 311, 430, 12845, 11, 13482, 3796, 54187, 17177, 2493, 535, 87218, 11, 690, 682, 387, 14356, 79306, 369, 279, 16520, 13, 9635, 690, 3552, 279, 10937, 11, 902, 8638, 389, 6250, 220, 972, 11, 323, 279, 33997, 315, 87218, 596, 3185, 617, 743, 279, 29531, 369, 44632, 66223, 596, 1510, 19037, 439, 814, 1427, 311, 3243, 389, 2162, 17614, 13, 17177, 2493, 535, 87218, 320, 2414, 8, 323, 12565, 3919, 95666, 320, 1315, 8, 690, 387, 961, 315, 94455, 596, 49927, 2128, 420, 7474, 13, 4435, 11098, 26526, 18984, 28280, 323, 28574, 423, 543, 351, 26205, 690, 1101, 387, 6532, 304, 279, 16520, 13, 95666, 37350, 279, 11230, 6068, 5915, 311, 3041, 9635, 12845, 304, 279, 1620, 2403, 8494, 304, 220, 1049, 18, 13, 95666, 653, 41119, 83, 2915, 28219, 279, 11230, 6068, 5915, 369, 279, 3816, 16344, 2403, 8494, 304, 279, 1620, 220, 717, 1667, 4227, 11, 1418, 28280, 16957, 9635, 596, 1193, 1456, 304, 279, 33522, 88, 2442, 324, 14029, 220, 508, 12, 1114, 38586, 1306, 5066, 7394, 13, 10058, 16431, 276, 11, 889, 10936, 43868, 8494, 430, 1938, 323, 1101, 6476, 304, 279, 74810, 220, 2550, 24, 9935, 98141, 3185, 11, 374, 1101, 961, 315, 94455, 596, 1584, 5352, 13, 33600, 23782, 323, 14990, 1940, 32997, 88147, 11355, 323, 17520, 507, 28805, 81, 3510, 980, 690, 1101, 387, 6532, 304, 279, 10401, 11, 902, 690, 387, 6197, 555, 34756, 3842, 763, 424, 35283, 13, 11355, 11, 279, 1176, 30447, 8485, 6721, 47550, 2851, 11, 312, 26500, 813, 49927, 3560, 505, 220, 679, 16, 323, 507, 28805, 81, 3510, 980, 32860, 264, 4435, 11098, 505, 279, 70513, 369, 279, 1176, 892, 2533, 220, 2550, 20, 1306, 60873, 505, 279, 1847, 1566, 1060, 13, 88147, 11355, 320, 2414, 8, 323, 17520, 507, 28805, 81, 3510, 980, 320, 1315, 8, 690, 1101, 387, 6532, 304, 94455, 596, 10401, 420, 7474, 13, 33600, 8013, 323, 18088, 33865, 323, 19627, 7395, 17177, 29335, 23778, 2176, 5776, 11, 74810, 220, 2550, 20, 4987, 10384, 24862, 92471, 393, 3675, 74709, 11, 1561, 17340, 596, 26044, 37778, 65320, 11, 8494, 596, 8096, 21820, 34856, 323, 6941, 24492, 1543, 4686, 279, 1160, 315, 79306, 13, 452, 532, 75, 26685, 2194, 11, 94455, 7690, 315, 10775, 11, 1071, 25, 364, 32, 52002, 4435, 11098, 21685, 555, 9635, 374, 264, 3131, 304, 264, 9659, 1567, 323, 433, 596, 1057, 26632, 439, 279, 14079, 12707, 60983, 311, 4546, 22511, 279, 2539, 5536, 315, 682, 279, 1957, 323, 20356, 6957, 1148, 584, 3987, 690, 387, 459, 61098, 16520, 13, 364, 1687, 4510, 584, 3077, 35105, 264, 1917, 15144, 1584, 709, 315, 47550, 11005, 889, 11, 1555, 872, 1866, 19248, 11, 3217, 323, 33638, 11939, 369, 279, 1847, 649, 1520, 6493, 279, 1888, 3284, 10401, 369, 1884, 10307, 520, 2162, 3238, 9635, 690, 387, 16026, 369, 27025, 520, 12015, 9890, 5721, 520, 279, 220, 679, 20, 4435, 11098, 382, 19791, 25], prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

A clairvoyant who swindled almost £70,000 in disability benefit by claiming he could barely was jailed after he was filmed working out in a gym. Spiritualist Timothy Abbott, 53, conned the taxpayer out of thousands of pounds in disability, council tax and housing benefits along with his wife Jeanette, 46. The couple pocketed a total of £170,000 during their 16-year scam, including Mr Abbott taking £35,496 in incapacity benefit and £22,848 in disability living allowance. The medium was filmed lifting heavy dumbbells, using an exercise bike, rowing machine and running on a treadmill and pleaded guilty to\xa0two counts of failing to notify the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) of a change in circumstances. Mr Abbott also admitted conning HMRC out of £9,532 by failing to pay income tax or national insurance contributions. Meanwhile his wife falsely claimed £19,477 in disability allowance and £713 in incapacity benefit, along with £1,000 in council tax benefit, Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court heard. Investigators filmed her bending down and carrying a heavy shoulder bag while on a shopping trip in 2012. She also failed to pay £37,000 worth of income support and conned Staffordshire County Council out of £44,000 in housing benefits. On his website, Abbott is described as being one of Britain's most 'evidential platform Mediums'. It goes on to say he was aware of the spirit world from the age of 19 before he 'embarked on his journey of development' by studying for over 30 years. His services are apparently in demand in countries such as Austria, Germany, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and Canada. He and his wife lived together in a modern £200,000 detached house in Stafford until their scam, which went on for 16 years between 1998 and 2014, was rumbled. Mr Abbott - who advertises himself as an 'international spiritualist clairvoyant medium and tutor' - was yesterday jailed for eight months. Mrs Abbott admitted three counts of failing to notify the DWP of a change in circumstances, one count of making a false statement and one of falsely obtaining benefits by deception. She was handed an eight-month prison sentence, suspended for 18 months. Abbott's scam was rumbled after investigators filmed him working out in a gym and lifting dumbbells. Abbott (pictured on a rowing machine) also admitted conning HMRC out of £9,532 by failing to pay income tax or national insurance contributions. The medium\xa0pleaded guilty to two counts of failing to notify the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) of a change in circumstances after he was filmed in a gym while claiming thousands in disability benefits. His wife Jeanette also falsely claimed a raft of benefits and was handed an eight-month prison sentence, suspended for 18 months. After the case, a DWP spokesman said: 'Benefit fraud is a crime and we are dedicated to catching those who commit it. 'Only a small minority of benefit claimants are dishonest, but cases like this cost the taxpayer money that should be used to help those in need. 'We are determined to find those who we suspect are cheating the system by following up on tip-offs, undertaking surveillance and working with local councils.' A proceeds of crime hearing on June 30 will determine how much the couple must pay back. Speaking after the sentencing, Mrs Abbott said: 'It has been two and half years of hell and I don't really want to talk about it as my husband got put away yesterday. It's killing me.' 'In our opinion the truth has not been fully told and we feel very unfairly treated.'\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0,

A political party's attempt to use LOL cat memes as part of their election campaign has backfired after social media users pointed out they should be focusing on policy not comedy. NSW Labor, whose leader Luke Foley is campaigning to win the upcoming state election, posted a series of cat memes targeted at Liberal Premier Mike Baird on Saturday which they renamed 'Caturday'. But the party's Facebook fans were quick to point out cat memes had ‘become a bit passé’ and blasted ‘get your message across in an adult way, as it is adults who vote’. One meme showed two cats yawning with the tagline: ‘Mike Baird says prices won’t go up. LOL.’ Another showed a grumpy looking cat with the line: ‘Electricity privatisation… no.’ While a cute post showed a cat and a kitten cuddling with the words: ‘Labor is investing in schools for your little one.’ One fan of the NSW Labor party page, Sammy Yousef, wrote: ‘This is the best you’ve got? Freakin’ lolcats? That’s your counterargument? 'You have the easiest job of any opposition in the history of this country and you’re being so idiotic about it there’s STILL a danger we’ll end up with LNP.’ NSW Labor posted a series of cat memes targeted at Liberal Premier Mike Baird on Saturday which they renamed 'Caturday' One of NSW Labor's Facebook posts includes a grumpy looking cat with the words 'Mike Baird... no' One fan of the NSW Labor party page, Sammy Yousef, wrote: ‘This is the best you’ve got? Freakin’ lolcats?' Will Sawyer said: ‘Seriously using grumpy cat for political advertisement is seriously cringe worthy. I say this out of concern.’ On March 28, NSW residents will be required to vote for the 56th Parliament. Jason Muller commented: ‘Omfg how pathetic! Ur resorting to using cats to get votes!... Game over! Jesus Christ!’ Jenni May said: ‘Why the Hallmark cat ads? Aren’t you trying to sell intelligent political concepts. This approach will alienate all the “dog” people out there.’ '$1,000+ courses at TAFE? No thanks,' NSW Labor wrote alongside this cute kitten. Kate Marksell called for less cat posts and more 'policy, policy, policy please' 'Take it from this cat - whatever Mike Baird tries to tell you, prices will go up when he sells off our electricity network,' NSW Labor said on Facebook. The NSW Labor party used this sleeping kitten picture to illustrate how 'under Mike Baird, $3 billion has been ripped out of our healthcare system' Jason Muller commented: 'Ur resorting to using cats to get votes!' 'Really cats? Is this what political debate in NSW has come too,’ Anthony Bosh wrote. Bev Little wrote: ‘No more cats environment not friendly.’ Kate Marksell instructed: ‘OK, I like cats but enough with the cats. Policy, policy, policy please.’ ‘Yeah but honestly pictures of cats on them has become a bit passé,’ Peter Humble replied. ‘Most people aren’t posting pictures of their own cats anymore, text or no text. Whenever I see a cat come up in my newsfeed I’m like really? ‘Which one of my friends forgot to change their calendar over at the end of 2011. Then I look and see it’s the NSW Labor party. It’s 2015. Enough with the cats.’ NSW Labor said: 'Poll after poll shows that voters do not support Mike Baird's plan to sell off our electricity' Colin Price added: 'This cat could literally lose you the election. And you were doing so well' Sam Parker said NSW Labor has posted 'too many cat memes' 'NSW Labor has a plan to invest $1.3 billion into building and updating schools and TAFE,' they Facebook page claimed. According to this grumpy cat post 'Mike Baird doesn't have a Plan B' Natalie Roseworn commented: ‘Agree. Posting memes of cats does nothing to make you appear professional or progressive, both of which I presume you want to appear. Get your message across in an adult way, as it is adults who vote.’ Sam Parker joked: ‘Too many cat memes… purr real.’ Colin Price added: ‘This cat could literally lose you the election. And you were doing so well.’ ‘Really cats? Is this what political debate in NSW has come too,’ Anthony Bosh wrote. NSW Labor replied: ‘On Caturday? Yes.’ Mike Baird turned down a present of expensive Australian Grange wine from radio show hosts Kyle and Jackie O on Monday. It was a gift of the bottle of the exclusive wine which saw his\xa0predecessor, Barry O'Farrell resign. NSW Premier Mike Baird and Leader of the Opposition Luke Foley took part in a televised debate in Sydney on Sunday. On Sunday afternoon, Mr Baird and Mr Foley went head-to-head in front of 100 swinging voters in Sydney's west. Mr Baird's plan to sell the electricity network's poles and wires dominated the second leaders debate. The premier insisted electricity prices will not rise under the plan but Mr Foley dismissed his guarantees as the'shortest of short-term fixes to get you through an election'. On Monday, Mr Baird turned down a present of expensive Australian Grange wine from radio show hosts Kyle and Jackie O. Mr Baird got the top job after his predecessor Barry O'Farrell stepped down after it was revealed he’d received a $3,000 bottle of Grange from Australian Water Holdings (AWH) executive Nick Di

Izola Ware Curry, who stabbed the civil rights leader in the chest with a seven-inch letter opener, died at a Queens, New York, nursing home where she moved several years ago. She died on Saturday March 7, according to The Smoking Gun. Izola Ware Curry, (right in 1958) 98, died on March 7, more than 56 years after she attempted to kill Dr Martin Luther King Jr with a letter opener at a Harlem book signing. Curry attacked the civil rights leader because she had delusions that he and the NAACP were watching her and preventing her from holding a job. Curry was originally sent to Matteawan State Hospital for the Criminally Insane and spent many years living anonymously despite the 1958 attack at Blumstein's Department Store in Harlem. She was also carrying a loaded pistol in her bra at the time. Dr King survived the incident at Blumstein's Department Store, where he was signing his first book Stride Toward Freedom, by fractions of an inch. The knife came close to puncturing his aorta and he could have died at the store if bystanders had taken the weapon out of his chest before his three-hour surgery. He referred to the incident in his I've Been To The Mountaintop speech, the last remarks he gave before his assassination on April 4, 1968 by James Earl Ray. The Nobel Peace Prize winner said that if he had sneezed then he would have died after being stabbed by the 'demented black woman'. Curry, who believed that the NAACP and Dr King had been watching her and preventing her from getting employment, was originally sent to Matteawan State Hospital for the Criminally Insane. Dr King had been signing his first book, Stride Toward Freedom, when Curry approached and stabbed him. The attacker was also carrying a loaded pistol in her bra. She was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and had an estimated IQ of 70. Dr King, who would accomplish some of his life's greatest work in the next ten years, said he bore her no ill will after the attack. He said that the incident 'demonstrates that a climate of hatred and bitterness so permeates our nation that inevitably deeds of extreme violence must erupt'. Born in Georgia in 1916, she moved between Georgia, Florida, St. Louis, and New York and worked as a housekeeper, factory worker and cook. However, her mentally illness made it difficult for her to keep a job. She remained in state custody at mental health institutions and the 'family care' program in peoples homes. He delusions and imagined voices were reportedly gone by 1980.

Please output the summary only, without any other text.\n\nArticle:\nDavid Jubb, the artistic director of Battersea Arts Centre, said he was 'overwhelmed' by public generosity after a fire ripped through the Grade II listed building last night. The 'heartbroken' artistic director of Battersea Arts Centre said he was overwhelmed by public generosity after a fire ripped through the Grade II listed building last night. Donations began flooding in as soon as news broke that the 120-year-old arts building was on fire at just after 4.15pm yesterday, which engulfed the roof and destroyed the Grand Hall and Lower Hall. Nearly 1,000 people have now given money to an appeal set up by the charity National Funding Scheme which has raised more than £22,000 in just 24 hours. More than 80 firefighters battled to bring the blaze under control, some fighting the fire from above using aerial platform ladders. Billowing black smoke was seen for miles around the theatre while there were reports of people watching on in tears as flames engulfed the tower at the top of the centre, which then collapsed. London Fire Brigade were able to save half of the building, including the 'priceless' octagonal dome, and salvage artwork from the centre, while some crews remained at the scene yesterday damping down hot spots. The centre reopened parts of the building  undamaged by fire for performances last night. Battersea's artistic director David Jubb said: 'The most important thing' was that nobody was hurt in the fire. 'It's heartbreaking. But we will get through this. Brick by brick. 'Huge thanks are owed to all the emergency services, who literally saved the front half of the building, to staff, artists and volunteers at Battersea Arts Centre, and to everyone who has shown their overwhelming support online over the last 24 hours. 'The passion for the building and the organisation is extraordinary. Thank you all for being part of this. We really need you at this time.' The cause of the fire is unclear but investigators were continuing to sift through the ashes yesterday to look for clues. Station Manager Matt Burrows, who visited the scene, said: 'Firefighters did a great job to save large parts of the building including the octagonal dome which I'm told is priceless and salvaged valuable art work. 'The centre are hopeful that they will be able to open unaffected areas of the building to the public today. We'll continue to damp down and our fire investigators are inspecting the building to find the cause.' Scroll down for video. The aftermath: The remains of the Battersea Arts Centre in south London after a blaze ripped through the building last night, damaging half and destroying the 120-year-old structure's roof. The outline of the Grade II listed building disappeared in the smoke and flames that engulfed the roof and destroyed the tower yesterday. Black smoke and flames could be seen for miles after the massive blaze broke out out at the historic Battersea Arts Centre in south London at just after 4.15pm yesterday. This incredible photo shows the flames of the inferno reaching up into the sky behind nearby homes who were warned to keep doors and windows closed against the smoke. Firefighters had advised people living and working nearby to keep doors and windows closed as a precaution after the fire broke out yesterday afternoon. By midnight on Friday, the fire service had scaled back the effort to four fire engines and around thirty firefighters who battled to get the fire under control. An ambulance service spokesman said crews had treated a woman for smoke inhalation at the scene but she had not required hospital treatment. Nicholas Bennett, a magistrate at nearby Lavender Hill Magistrates' Court, said yesterday that black smoke had been 'everywhere, engulfing the  area.' Rumours that the nearby Clapham Junction railway station had been evacuated were confirmed false by Network Rail but Lavender Hill was closed in both directions. Battersea Arts Centre had tweeted that yesterday's performance of Missing was cancelled due to the blaze. Fire destroyed the Grand Hall and Lower Hall but London Fire Brigade were able to save half of the building including the 'priceless' octagonal dome. Flames had engulfed the roof of the Grade II listed property which later collapsed into the theatre building which was surrounded by scaffolding. London Fire Brigade confirmed that half of the building was damaged by the fire with some parts being completely destroyed. 'Thank you to everyone for the kind words & well wishes,' a spokesman added. London Fire Brigade\xa0Station Manager John Snelgrove, who was at the scene said yesterday: 'This is a large, challenging fire and crews are working hard to bring it under control. We've got 12 fire engines at the scene, as well as an aerial appliance and an aerial ladder platform fighting the fire from above. 'Firefighters are working with a number of water jets around the building to contain the fire.' Twelve fire engines and around 80 firefighters were called to tackle the fire Battersea Arts Centre with two aerial appliances - similar to cherry pickers - used to fight the fire from above. At the outbreak of the blaze the Brigade's control officers took over fifty 999 calls from members of the public. Billowing black smoke could be seen for miles from the arts centre as the fire took hold, which needed almost 60 firefighters to try and tackle it. Officers make their way to the blaze in Lavender Hill which has now been shut in both directions as firefighters continue to battle the fire. The London Fire Brigade said that eight fire engines and more than 80 firefighters were dealing with arts centre blaze in Battersea. The arts centre had tweeted: 'There is a fire in our building. Everyone is out safe and the fire brigade are working hard to get the fire under control.' Comedian Paul Foxcroft, who saw the blaze, said: 'The first thing I saw when I came out of my house were several fire engines hurtling past, then I saw grey smoke in the sky. 'Crowds had started to gather. There were two ladies outside with tears in their eyes. I heard one saying 'Please save it' as more firemen arrived. 'It is an institution, not just for Battersea, but for the whole of the city of London. It is hugely popular so this fire will affect a lot of people. The back of the building was under renovation.' There was an outpouring of grief on Twitter as people expressed their horror yesterday at losing part of the Arts Centre. Dan Price tweeted: 'So sad. London Fire fighting bravely to save Battersea Arts. Everyone is out safely.' Senior Producer at the BAC Richard Dufty tweeted: 'Terrible news. Battersea Arts is on fire. The Grand Hall roof.' Tom Copley \u200fsaid: 'Oh no! Battersea Arts, one of London's most wonderful theatres, is on fire. Hope that no one is hurt and that the building can be saved.' An ambulance service spokesman confirmed that crews had attended the scene but no-one was injured, while occupants nearby were warned to keep their windows closed against the billowing black smoke. The fire could be seen clearly from a nearby train station, sparking fears that Clapham Junction was being evacuated- the rumours were later confirmed as false. Fans of the centre also tweeted their support including James Phillips who tweeted about the 'tragic loss' of the building. Baylen Leonard wrote on Twitter:'Awful news about fire at Battersea Arts Centre, one of the most innovative and forward thinking arts centres in UK.' Louise Allen-Jones posted:'Devastated to hear Battersea Arts Centre is on fire. Love that building so much.' One twitter user said: 'Tower on the top of Battersea Arts Centre has just collapsed. People in tears. Police moving people back.' James Phillips added: 'The Battersea Arts Centre fire is apparently contained but large parts of the Grand Hall (which survived the Blitz) are gone. A tragic loss.' The building, which was designed in 1891 by E. W. Mountforcentre, was originally opened in 1893 as Battersea Town Hall. The space was converted to a community arts centre in 1974. The popular arts venue hosts a regular series of plays and dance shows. It is a registered charity, which raises 70 per cent of its own income every year. Fire crews have not yet been able to determine what the cause of the fire today at Battersea Arts Centre's Grand Hall roof.

Van der Garde, who was axed as test driver by Sauber at the end of last season, claims he was promised a full-time race seat for the forthcoming campaign that begins in Australia this weekend. Sauber eventually hired Sweden's Marcus Ericsson and Brazilian Felipe Nasr, but Van der Garde has already seen an arbitration panel in Switzerland rule in his favour and is now looking for that decision to be enforced ahead of the season-opener. Giedo van Der Garde, pictured at testing in 2014 was the reserve driver for Sauber last season. Dutch driver  claims he was offered a race seat for the 2015 campaign but Sauber reneged on deal. The Supreme Court in Victoria, Australia, announced on Monday via its official Twitter account that a judgement in Van der Garde's case would be reserved until 10am Wednesday local time (11pm Tuesday night UK time). The Swiss tribunal recently ordered Sauber 'to refrain from taking action' that would deny Van der Garde one of the two race seats, but Sauber are determined to fight their corner. Team principal Monisha Kaltenborn, a former lawyer, said on Friday: 'As this matter is currently before the courts it would be inappropriate for me to comment on specific details. 'However, we will take all necessary steps to protect our company, this team and its interests. 'Last year was a challenging time for us, but going into the 2015 season we have been focused on putting steps in place to ensure we are delivering the best outcomes for F1's fans.'\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=128, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=False, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: [128000, 9370, 5730, 553, 279, 2768, 3754, 4652, 304, 220, 4386, 11460, 13, 5321, 2612, 279, 12399, 1193, 11, 2085, 904, 1023, 1495, 382, 17064, 512, 53776, 3861, 5696, 480, 88151, 5355, 2761, 12471, 451, 596, 4465, 369, 264, 7102, 10954, 369, 279, 220, 679, 20, 3280, 1288, 3351, 264, 3094, 87920, 311, 264, 17102, 389, 8079, 13, 13000, 2761, 12471, 451, 11, 889, 574, 3944, 291, 439, 1296, 5696, 555, 16233, 30970, 520, 279, 842, 315, 1566, 3280, 11, 8349, 568, 574, 19487, 264, 2539, 7394, 7102, 10954, 369, 279, 45764, 4901, 430, 12302, 304, 8494, 420, 9178, 13, 16233, 30970, 9778, 22163, 24067, 596, 36783, 16645, 31031, 323, 36083, 82547, 39322, 81, 11, 719, 13000, 2761, 12471, 451, 706, 2736, 3970, 459, 54708, 7090, 304, 30221, 6037, 304, 813, 12617, 323, 374, 1457, 3411, 369, 430, 5597, 311, 387, 45421, 8469, 315, 279, 3280, 30592, 804, 13, 480, 88151, 5355, 13031, 12471, 451, 11, 42666, 520, 7649, 304, 220, 679, 19, 574, 279, 21137, 5696, 369, 16233, 30970, 1566, 3280, 13, 24113, 5696, 220, 8349, 568, 574, 9076, 264, 7102, 10954, 369, 279, 220, 679, 20, 4901, 719, 16233, 30970, 5790, 797, 291, 389, 3568, 13, 578, 13814, 7301, 304, 23225, 11, 8494, 11, 7376, 389, 7159, 4669, 1202, 4033, 6405, 2759, 430, 264, 48919, 304, 13000, 2761, 12471, 451, 596, 1162, 1053, 387, 4694, 3156, 220, 605, 309, 8079, 2254, 892, 320, 806, 5298, 7742, 3814, 6560, 892, 570, 578, 30791, 63992, 6051, 11713, 16233, 30970, 364, 998, 58608, 505, 4737, 1957, 6, 430, 1053, 23973, 13000, 2761, 12471, 451, 832, 315, 279, 1403, 7102, 16712, 11, 719, 16233, 30970, 527, 11075, 311, 4465, 872, 9309, 13, 8068, 12717, 3206, 36040, 27930, 2002, 16381, 11, 264, 4846, 15779, 11, 1071, 389, 6740, 25, 364, 2170, 420, 5030, 374, 5131, 1603, 279, 19359, 433, 1053, 387, 33781, 369, 757, 311, 4068, 389, 3230, 3649, 13, 364, 11458, 11, 584, 690, 1935, 682, 5995, 7504, 311, 6144, 1057, 2883, 11, 420, 2128, 323, 1202, 12034, 13, 364, 5966, 1060, 574, 264, 17436, 892, 369, 603, 11, 719, 2133, 1139, 279, 220, 679, 20, 3280, 584, 617, 1027, 10968, 389, 10917, 7504, 304, 2035, 311, 6106, 584, 527, 24944, 279, 1888, 20124, 369, 435, 16, 596, 7359, 22438, 19791, 25], prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

Five-year-old Seth Lane has one wish - for the world to wear his favourite colour, yellow. The brave youngster lives in a \'bubble\' and can only dream of life outside the confines of his hospital room. He is bound to his bed by a rare immune disorder, which has made the outside, germ-infested world his enemy. Seth was born without an immune system and has lived in a sterile environment for more than half of his short life. Following an unsuccessful bone marrow transplant, his immune system turned on him once again. Since January the five-year-old has been forced to live in his hospital room. As he waits for a life-changing second bone marrow transplant Seth has made a heartbreaking video, watched by more than two million people, in which he appeals for people to show their support. Using speech boards the adorable youngster asks people to wear yellow on March 27, and post a picture on Twitter, Facebook or Instagram with the hashtag #WearyellowforSeth. Seth\'s parents, Leanne and Nik Lane, from Corby in Northamptonshire, said they have been astonished when the video went viral, with more than 2.5 million views in a matter of days. Hundreds of thousands of strangers have already pledged to wear yellow to show Seth they are thinking of him. The video features a smiling Seth perched on his bed holding up yellow cards asking for support. He said: \'Hello I\'m Seth. I\'m five-years-old and I love Fireman Sam, Paw Patrol and yellow. \'I\'m in hospital, I was born with no immune system, and I need a second bone marrow transplant. \'On March 27 lots of people are going to wear yellow to show me how much support I have. Are you going to join in? \'Post a picture of you wearing yellow to Facebook, Twitter or Instagram with #wearyellowforseth.\' Mrs Lane, a full-time mother-of-two, said: \'We never meant to start any sort of campaign, and only expected friends and family to join in. \'I can\'t believe it has taken off like this. It is overwhelming. Scroll down for video. The five-year-old was born without an immune system, leaving him vulnerable to picking up life-threatening infections. The condition, known as \'bubble disease\' requires sufferers to live in a sterile \'bubble\' \'I don\'t think there is a single country in the world that hasn\'t got someone who has got involved. \'It all helps show Seth that people are thinking of him. I told him about the views and he asked, "Is it more than 20?\' I said "yes it is" and he said "wowee".\' Seth was admitted to hospital at the age of six months with an extreme chest infection. His parents were told he had severe combined immunodeficiency. Known as \'bubble boy disease\' it is caused by a mutated gene and means the body\'s antibodies cannot respond to infections, leaving sufferers extremely vulnerable to germs. He was transferred to Great Ormond Street Hospital where he had a bone marrow transplant from donor umbilical cord cells. But he was kept in a \'bubble\' - unable to interact with children, go to nursery or play outside in parks - for two years while his body got stronger. Mrs Lane, who has a five-month-old son Hugo with her husband, Nik, 31, said: \'He had no contact with other children until he was two-and-a-half. \'We would go out in the pram and I would have to put the rain cover over him with a little fan inside - people probably thought I was mad.\' But after just a couple of years of normality - after Seth had started school and made his first best friends - his body turned on him in October. When he had his transplant as a baby he developed graft versus host disease - where his donated cells saw his own body cells as foreign and attacked them. A first bone marrow transplant failed, when his immune system turned on him. It means Seth is now confined to his hospital room once more, waiting for a second transplant. His father Nik Lane is set to be Seth\'s donor, and doctors are waiting until the five-year-old is well enough before performing the operation. Seth\'s parents recorded an adorable video of him holding up screen cards, appealing for people to wear his favourite colour, yellow, to show their support. It has so far been viewed by more than two million people. Initially, it only affected his skin - leaving him with painful red patches - but in October it turned on his own bone marrow, once again wiping out his entire immune system. Seth returned to his \'bubble\' - an ultra-hygienic single room at Newcastle\'s Great North Children\'s Hospital - in a bid to keep him free from potentially lethal infections, in January. \'If I\'m a bit run down and have a coldsore I can\'t touch him,\' said Mrs Lane. \'And if we have a cold we can\'t go in at all. \'Everything has to be sterilised and his room has filtered air. The staff are scrupulous with cleaning. \'Nothing can leave the room once it has come in and been cleaned, his soft toys are washed at 60 degrees every couple of days and his bed sheets are boil washed every day. \'Nik is with him all the time so his clothes have to be washed at 60 every day and Seth has never been out the room.\' His father - who will be a donor for Seth once he is well enough - recorded the video of Seth last week. In just six days it has attracted 2,483,855 views and hundreds of thousands of people have messaged Mrs Lane to say they are planning on wearing yellow. It is thought Seth will have his transplant in around six weeks, but will probably have to remain in near-isolation for around a year after the operation. \'It\'s hard for him, and he is getting bored, but he never complains and he understands,\' said Mrs Lane. After his operation and around a year in a sterile environment, Seth\'s parents hope he will be able to play with his friends and little brother again.\n\nSummary:', params: SamplingParams(n=1,

Please output the summary only, without any other text.\n\nArticle:\n(CNN)As the world awaits a possible nuclear agreement between the United States and Iran, let us not forget: This is the second time in two years that President Barack Obama has pursued a nonproliferation deal with an unreformed regime in the Middle East. In doing so, he has ignored the regimes\' fundamental nature and the catastrophic costs these efforts have inflicted upon regional stability and U.S. national security. This month brought familiar news: more chemical weapons attacks allegedly by dictator Bashar al-Assad against his fellow Syrians. Just in June, the administration declared the success of its deal to remove al-Assad\'s chemical weapons, which had been prompted by his August 2013 sarin attacks on Syrian civilians and the threat of U.S. airstrikes in response. The deal did yield an important victory -- the removal and destruction of more than 1,200 metric tons of al-Assad\'s chemical weapons arsenal, which he can no longer use to threaten Syrians and Israel or fall into terrorist hands. However, with his actions as evidence, it was a deal that al-Assad likely knew he could manipulate. Even while the deal was underway, al-Assad continued to attack Syrian civilians and the opposition with weaponized chlorine bombs, exploiting a loophole in the agreement. The deal was also fundamentally flawed in that it relied upon al-Assad to declare his stockpile voluntarily without sufficient third-party verification. Just weeks after claiming success, the administration quietly acknowledged that al-Assad had secretly retained some of his most lethal chemical weapons. Al-Assad has also failed to destroy some of his chemical weapons facilities, as the agreement required. The deal made al-Assad a partner of sorts to the administration despite the grisly, mass atrocities he continued to commit. During implementation, the administration limited its support to the moderate opposition and did little else to pressure the regime to restrain its attacks on civilians or to allow a political transition. About 50,000 more Syrians were killed in the conflict during these months -- mostly at the hands of the regime -- and the displacement of millions of Syrians throughout the region continued. Meanwhile, ISIS further exploited the civil war, expanding into security voids. There are several troubling parallels between the administration\'s deal with al-Assad and the one it is now pursuing with Tehran. Both represent deep cynicism or a fundamentally naïve understanding of the regimes with which we are negotiating. In both cases, the administration has tried to reach common ground with the world\'s foremost sponsors of terrorist groups such as Hezbollah, Hamas and al Qaeda -- which these regimes have funded, trained or sheltered. All of this was true before the administration started these negotiations, and it remains true today. Neither Tehran nor al-Assad has changed ways and chosen normalization with the international community. To the contrary, external factors forced them into situations in which they had to cooperate at least ostensibly on isolated issues -- al-Assad on chemical weapons due to threatened airstrikes and Tehran on its nuclear program due to crippling sanctions. Both have only reluctantly engaged and have taken steps to delay, obstruct and circumvent verifiable agreements. As continues to be the case with al-Assad, Tehran has been emboldened by the administration\'s approach. It has increased lethal support to al-Assad in Syria, deployed troops and supported sectarian militias in Iraq, and ramped up aid to other militant groups, including the insurgent Houthis in Yemen. These activities are now exacerbating the very humanitarian and terrorist crises that Iran helped cause by preventing political compromise in Iraq and Syria. As was the case with al-Assad, a deal will effectively make Tehran a partner to the administration in which the White House accepts the Iranian regime\'s legitimacy by virtue of the agreement. And there will still be little confidence that Tehran will actually honor the terms of any deal it accepts. Even while negotiations have been underway, Iran has been caught procuring illicit nuclear technology. The regime has a track record of concealing nuclear facilities and obstructing the International Atomic Energy Agency\'s access to others, including its infamous Parchin base. As IAEA Director General Yukiya Amano confirmed again this week, Tehran has still only partially answered one of the IAEA\'s long-standing, 12 questions on possible military dimensions of its passed nuclear activities. Amid his continued calls for "death to America," Iran\'s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, tweeted his demand just last week that sanctions be lifted immediately as a part of any deal, not as a result of verified observance of a deal. Tehran has demonstrated repeatedly that it will not allow verification of its passed activities or allow actual compliance to be a prerequisite for further sanctions relief. Without a complete understanding of Iran\'s program, the international community does not have the information it needs for a responsible deal. A regime so committed to supporting terrorism, violently oppressing its own people and others, threatening U.S. national security and destroying Israel cannot be trusted. And without trust and verification there can be no acceptable deal. The world has witnessed the results of such a naïve arrangement before -- an unprecedented rise of terrorism, a grave humanitarian crisis and a blatant disregard for human life. We are seeing it once again in response to the administration\'s efforts with Iran. As we learned with Syria\'s al-Assad, making a deal with a terrorist-supporting tyrant yields disaster down the road. Let\'s not make that mistake twice.\n\nSummary:', params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0,

Not standard procedure by any means, but some passengers were lucky enough to receive a free dance performance from a flight attendant as they waited for take-off. Standing at the front of the plane, presumably after she had delivered her safety speech, the flight attendant - who it is believed works for Canadian airline WestJet - can be seen strumming along to a beat. As the vocals to Mark Ronson and Bruno Mars’ 'Uptown Funk' kick in the lady springs into action and begins throwing some moves. One passenger attempts to film her from the aisle, but quickly retreats his phone after the dancer begins moving towards him. Returning to her original position the lady continues boogying until the music ceases and she is met with a round of applause from the passengers. The breakdancer turned flight attendant dances along to Mark Ronson and Bruno Mars' hit 'Uptown Funk' A passengers attempts to record the lady from the aisle but quickly retreats his phone after she begins dancing towards him. Judging by the lady’s uniform she is a flight attendant with WestJet Airlines, a budget carrier from Canada. Reddit user Simian_King, who uploaded the original video, claims that the lady is his sister and a breakdancer turned flight attendant. However, despite this, she in fact appears to be locking – a style of funk dancing associated with Hip-Hop that involves freezing a certain movement from a fast moving position before continuing at the same speed. Judging by the her uniform, the lady who performs to the passengers on the flight is an employee of Canada's WestJet Airlines.\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=128, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=False, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: [128000, 9370, 5730, 553, 279, 2768, 3754, 4652, 304, 220, 4386, 11460, 13, 5321, 2612, 279, 12399, 1193, 11, 2085, 904, 1023, 1495, 382, 17064, 512, 5618, 6106, 701, 10954, 76948, 374, 5043, 6901, 369, 1935, 12744, 323, 430, 682, 6920, 10539, 3673, 527, 9967, 52123, 779, 430, 89795, 645, 323, 43186, 527, 2867, 13, 1628, 1243, 2503, 1203, 11, 12234, 323, 4774, 279, 4704, 492, 16924, 27104, 315, 279, 13691, 13941, 13, 2876, 5410, 10537, 555, 904, 3445, 11, 719, 1063, 22961, 1051, 18069, 3403, 311, 5371, 264, 1949, 15612, 5178, 505, 264, 11213, 65022, 439, 814, 30315, 369, 1935, 12744, 13, 46327, 520, 279, 4156, 315, 279, 11277, 11, 36548, 1306, 1364, 1047, 12886, 1077, 7296, 8982, 11, 279, 11213, 65022, 482, 889, 433, 374, 11846, 4375, 369, 12152, 33575, 4410, 36741, 482, 649, 387, 3970, 610, 372, 5424, 3235, 311, 264, 9567, 13, 1666, 279, 47196, 311, 4488, 14662, 942, 323, 52210, 21725, 529, 364, 52, 418, 785, 40710, 6, 10536, 304, 279, 17240, 42242, 1139, 1957, 323, 12302, 21939, 1063, 11031, 13, 3861, 24023, 13865, 311, 4632, 1077, 505, 279, 60779, 11, 719, 6288, 31114, 82, 813, 4641, 1306, 279, 64682, 12302, 7366, 7119, 1461, 13, 74347, 311, 1077, 4113, 2361, 279, 17240, 9731, 712, 540, 7169, 3156, 279, 4731, 3846, 2315, 323, 1364, 374, 2322, 449, 264, 4883, 315, 64626, 505, 279, 22961, 13, 578, 1464, 67, 11967, 6656, 11213, 65022, 73806, 3235, 311, 4488, 14662, 942, 323, 52210, 21725, 6, 4295, 364, 52, 418, 785, 40710, 6, 362, 22961, 13865, 311, 3335, 279, 17240, 505, 279, 60779, 719, 6288, 31114, 82, 813, 4641, 1306, 1364, 12302, 29066, 7119, 1461, 13, 11462, 3252, 555, 279, 17240, 753, 14113, 1364, 374, 264, 11213, 65022, 449, 4410, 36741, 35230, 11, 264, 8199, 19115, 505, 7008, 13, 27728, 1217, 4567, 1122, 10310, 287, 11, 889, 23700, 279, 4113, 2835, 11, 8349, 430, 279, 17240, 374, 813, 13219, 323, 264, 1464, 67, 11967, 6656, 11213, 65022, 13, 4452, 11, 8994, 420, 11, 1364, 304, 2144, 8111, 311, 387, 38955, 1389, 264, 1742, 315, 69392, 29066, 5938, 449, 45628, 11529, 454, 430, 18065, 43318, 264, 3738, 7351, 505, 264, 5043, 7366, 2361, 1603, 14691, 520, 279, 1890, 4732, 13, 11462, 3252, 555, 279, 1077, 14113, 11, 279, 17240, 889, 27772, 311, 279, 22961, 389, 279, 11213, 374, 459, 9548, 315, 7008, 596, 4410, 36741, 35230, 382, 19791, 25], prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

Kevin Love, who was formerly the head chef at the multi-award winning Hinds Head pub in Bray, Berkshire, will help the budget chain source gourmet ingredients. The role as ‘chef in residence at Lidl’ will see him going head to head with his former mentor, who has had a long-term partnership with the upmarket chain Waitrose. Scroll down for video. Kevin Love (left) will go head to head with his former mentor Heston Blumenthal (right) The 38-year-old star chef will also feature in the chain’s commercials, help develop ‘Deluxe’ range products with ‘a few cheffy twists’ and offer recipe and cooking tips. The move is the latest effort by Lidl to attract Middle Britain shoppers who want good food but something different – and cheaper – than the mainstream supermarkets. This has involved pushing a range of ‘Deluxe’ foods, including Stilton, Hereford fillet steaks and Mussel & Smoked Salmon Chowder, which have beaten the best of the high street in blind taste tests. Heston Blumenthal has had a long relationship with Waitrose to create luxury meals. Lidl is chasing the customers of its upmarket rivals, the so-called ‘BMW classes' It has also won over wealthy shoppers with fine French wines at budget prices that have picked up gold medals in international competitions. The company’s current adverts are based around the theme of ‘Lidl Surprises’, where ordinary people are given fine food on a market stall only to be surprised that it comes from the discount store. Its Christmas TV campaign took up the theme with diners enjoying a fabulous festive spread only to be told at the end that all the food and drink came from Lidl. The first TV advert featuring the chef shows him cooking meals in a north London gastro pub, before wowing shocked customers by revealing the cheap cost of the Lidl-sourced ingredients. His role will involve sourcing produce that will be stocked in Lidl's more than 600 stores in the UK and working on food development. In a promotional video on Lidl's website, he reveals that he will be creating new lines in the firm’s deluxe range ‘with a few cheffy twists’. The partnership with the retailer brings Mr Love full circle, for just nine years ago he was a Lidl store manager before going off to develop his skills as a chef. Inspired by his mother’s cooking his path in the world of food began washing dishes in a Wimpy bar at the age of 14 and then peeling potatoes in the kitchens of Michelin star Catalan chef Santi Santamoria in Spain. Other jobs in cafes and bars in his native Sussex followed. Heston Blumenthal was key to Lidl's Christmas campaign. \xa0Kevin Love is to take on a similar role for Lidl's this easter. Subsequently, he saw Heston Blumenthal on TV and set his sights on working for his culinary hero. Within three months of starting at the Hinds Head he was made head chef and later won a Michelin star and three AA Rosettes. Mr Love said: ‘Lidl has a great foundation. I’m going to be working closely with buyers, suppliers and producers to see if we can take it to the next level. ‘Take a pie for instance. What other cuts of meat can we use? Can we slow cook or braise them? How about a water bath? How can make the pastry have more bite?’ Lidl head of advertising and marketing, Arnd Pickhardt, said the partnership goes will go far beyond the usual chef endorsement or product range. ‘Chef Love has joined the Lidl family full-time and will devote himself entirely to guiding the brand and customers on a journey of culinary discovery. As the partnership matures, so will Kevin’s role at Lidl,’ he said. ‘In addition to helping customers explore the possibilities inside every Lidl shop, he will be a brand champion and passionate advocate for technical simplicity.’\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0,

Butler was bidding to add to the bantamweight belt he reluctantly gave up last year, but Tete's eighth-round knock-out ensured it was the South African who emerged triumphant. Paul Butler's attempt to become a two-weight world champion ended in failure. Butler was\xa0stopped in the eighth round by a brutal uppercut from Zolani Tete. Tete dominated the early rounds and while Butler responded with a strong left-hook in round five, his opponent restored control in the sixth and seventh before landing the decisive blow. 'I knew Paul was a good fighter, but I knew I could knock him out,' Tete told BoxNation. 'Paul is shorter than me. I'm looking forward to defending my title again.' Butler was considered the pre-fight favourite but the 26-year-old conceded he had lost to the better fighter on the night. Tete dominated the early rounds\xa0at Liverpool's Echo Arena on Friday. Tete\xa0landed the decisive blow in the eighth round to claim the title. 'He was very good and very awkward, a better man on the night,' Butler said. 'I normally have people come towards me. He's a very big kid, and we knew his power by his record. He's a great champion.' It means Tete's record stands at 20-3 with 17 knock-outs while Butler is 17-1, after suffering his first career loss. 'He can come back,' promoter Frank Warren added. 'But he must learn from what happened.' Earlier in the night, British veteran Derry Mathews maintained his pursuit of the WBA lightweight title after stopping Hungarian Gyorgy Mizsei Jr in the fifth round. Mathews will now shift his attention to a clash with reigning champion Richar Abril on April 18.\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=128, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=False, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: [128000, 9370, 5730, 553, 279, 2768, 3754, 4652, 304, 220, 4386, 11460, 13, 5321, 2612, 279, 12399, 1193, 11, 2085, 904, 1023, 1495, 382, 17064, 512, 57, 337, 5676, 350, 7870, 69364, 264, 28860, 8582, 10453, 311, 3009, 13527, 596, 7043, 38325, 323, 3802, 12845, 304, 872, 12373, 37, 1917, 2307, 83985, 4870, 2316, 4465, 520, 25715, 596, 38906, 28145, 389, 6740, 13, 38325, 574, 49500, 311, 923, 311, 279, 293, 519, 309, 4870, 19671, 568, 84185, 6688, 709, 1566, 1060, 11, 719, 350, 7870, 596, 37477, 21691, 14459, 9994, 59754, 433, 574, 279, 4987, 11904, 889, 22763, 92906, 28022, 13, 7043, 38325, 596, 4879, 311, 3719, 264, 1403, 12923, 1917, 18824, 9670, 304, 8060, 13, 38325, 574, 4194, 90963, 304, 279, 37477, 4883, 555, 264, 28860, 8582, 10453, 505, 1901, 337, 5676, 350, 7870, 13, 350, 7870, 30801, 279, 4216, 20101, 323, 1418, 38325, 16846, 449, 264, 3831, 2163, 34960, 304, 4883, 4330, 11, 813, 15046, 28101, 2585, 304, 279, 26084, 323, 31487, 1603, 20948, 279, 51391, 12523, 13, 364, 40, 7020, 7043, 574, 264, 1695, 25902, 11, 719, 358, 7020, 358, 1436, 14459, 1461, 704, 2965, 350, 7870, 3309, 8425, 99727, 13, 364, 26368, 374, 24210, 1109, 757, 13, 358, 2846, 3411, 4741, 311, 29269, 856, 2316, 1578, 3238, 38325, 574, 6646, 279, 864, 2269, 492, 19214, 719, 279, 220, 1627, 4771, 6418, 62687, 568, 1047, 5675, 311, 279, 2731, 25902, 389, 279, 3814, 13, 350, 7870, 30801, 279, 4216, 20101, 4194, 266, 25715, 596, 38906, 28145, 389, 6740, 13, 350, 7870, 4194, 1974, 291, 279, 51391, 12523, 304, 279, 37477, 4883, 311, 3802, 279, 2316, 13, 364, 1548, 574, 1633, 1695, 323, 1633, 29859, 11, 264, 2731, 893, 389, 279, 3814, 2965, 38325, 1071, 13, 364, 40, 14614, 617, 1274, 2586, 7119, 757, 13, 1283, 596, 264, 1633, 2466, 10585, 11, 323, 584, 7020, 813, 2410, 555, 813, 3335, 13, 1283, 596, 264, 2294, 18824, 3238, 1102, 3445, 350, 7870, 596, 3335, 13656, 520, 220, 508, 12, 18, 449, 220, 1114, 14459, 85075, 1418, 38325, 374, 220, 1114, 12, 16, 11, 1306, 16066, 813, 1176, 7076, 4814, 13, 364, 1548, 649, 2586, 1203, 2965, 66642, 9454, 26713, 3779, 13, 364, 4071, 568, 2011, 4048, 505, 1148, 7077, 3238, 47993, 304, 279, 3814, 11, 8013, 21487, 423, 5515, 4242, 28844, 18908, 813, 33436, 315, 279, 468, 7209, 30244, 2316, 1306, 23351, 57869, 56015, 1813, 88, 72695, 73868, 16014, 304, 279, 18172, 4883, 13, 4242, 28844, 690, 1457, 6541, 813, 6666, 311, 264, 41003, 449, 91056, 18824, 8269, 277, 37501, 321, 389, 5936, 220, 972, 382, 19791, 25], prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

Please output the summary only, without any other text.\n\nArticle:\n(CNN)Empathy. Confidence. Passion. These are the traits the next police chief in Ferguson, Missouri, will need to shrink the ocean of distrust between community and police. So says Cecil Smith. And maybe he should know. Smith is the police chief in Sanford, Florida, another community rocked by racial tensions and poor police-community relations after the high-profile shooting of a black teenager -- the 2012 death of Trayvon Martin. And if Smith\'s experience is any guide, it will take "a lot of prayer and a little goading" to convince someone to step into the job vacated this week by Chief Thomas Jackson. "That community, as we see, has been hurting and struggling for some time now," he says. And how:. -- The community remains deeply scarred by the events last year, after the August shooting death of unarmed African-American teenager Michael Brown by a white Ferguson Officer Darren Wilson, and the November decision by the St. Louis County Grand Jury not to charge Wilson, who later resigned. Occasionally violent protests and sometimes heavy-handed responses by police deepened divisions and distrust. -- The police department was already groaning under the epic weight of months of nearly constant protest and last week\'s release of a damning Department of Justice report that found evidence of discriminatory conduct on the part of Ferguson officials. -- Add to that the obvious fears facing officers following the shooting early Thursday of two police officers only hours after Jackson resigned. The decision for Jackson to step aside was a mutual one between the chief and city, Mayor James Knowles told reporters. He\'ll get severance and a year of health insurance and will turn the reins over to Ferguson police Lt. Col Al Eickhoff next week. The city will launch a nationwide search for a permanent replacement, Knowles said. "The City of Ferguson looks to become an example of how a community can move forward in the face of adversity.  We are committed to keeping our police department and having one that exhibits the highest degree of professionalism and fairness," said Knowles -- who has himself been targeted by protesters demanding he resign. To get there, it might look to Sanford for guidance. There, trust in the police department bottomed out in the aftermath of the Trayvon Martin shooting. While no police officers were involved in the shooting, anger over their perceived failure to arrest the teenager\'s killer, George Zimmerman, pushed relations in the community to a boiling point, eventually resulting in the firing of Chief Bill Lee. Zimmerman eventually was arrested, and a jury acquitted him. Smith watched the chaos play out from Elgin, Illinois, where he was deputy police chief. A former boss in Illinois suggested he look at the job, so he traveled to Florida on his own time, getting to know the community and learning what divided residents and police. He still isn\'t sure how to explain why he took the job. "The first year, I was still wondering, was it a smart move?" Smith joked. But things are better now, he says. After taking the job, Smith made it a point of spending time "walking and talking" in Sanford, building relationships with community leaders and everyday residents. Inside the department, stepped up training in engagement and ethical policing. He also stepped up recruitment of African-American officers. "One of the things that\'s going on is we don\'t have people who look like us in the community," said Smith, himself an African-American. He handed out long-delayed promotions. And he even presided over a makeover, enlisting officers to help choose new uniforms. The new chief in Ferguson will likely need to do some of the same things, Smith says. Community leaders and other officials agree. "We need to deal with the culture issue here to make sure whoever is coming in behind Chief Jackson is not a new face and a new name on the same type of issues," Patricia Bynes, a Democratic committeewoman for Ferguson Township," told CNN Wednesday. "We need to seriously deal with the culture of the police department and the municipal courts and the way the city is run." New York police Commissioner William Bratton said there are two issues confronting the heads of police forces. There is the lack of trust on the community\'s part and the lack of confidence some officers have in their leadership. On the first issue, he said: "You need to be willing to embrace that there is a need to change." To police leadership consultant John Vanek, whoever takes over the Ferguson department will need to have the same leadership traits valued in boardrooms across the world -- the ability to form partnerships across organizational lines, to think differently, to turn failure into success and to do it all in a harsh media spotlight. But that\'s easier said than done. "There\'s going to be a lot of hostility in Ferguson for a long time," he said. So will the new chief need to be African-American to help defuse the racial tensions roiling the city? Here\'s the politic answer: Find the right candidate, regardless of race. "You want to find the best candidate to be police chief," said attorney Benjamin Crump, who has represented the families of both Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown.  "But diversity is very important. It\'s very important that the police officers understand the communities, at least want to engage with members of the community they are going to be protecting and serving." "There\'s an old saying in the black community that everybody else is protected and served but we are policed," Crump said. "We don\'t want to be policed. We want to be protected and served as any American citizen." CNN\'s Nick Valencia contributed to this report.\n\nSummary:', params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0,

Please output the summary only, without any other text.\n\nArticle:\nNew York City has spent $18 million in five years unclogging 'flushable' wet wipes from the sewer system. As the products have become increasingly popular, many manufacturers claim to have 'adapted' them to biodegrade when flushed. But the city's waste management directors have told the New York Times: that is not the case. 'Indestructible': Wet wipes branded as 'flushable' have been clogging up the system by twisting into knots. When the wipes twist into a knot and mix with grease or oil, they are'really indestructible,' deputy commissioner Vincent Sapienza of the Department of Environmental Protection said. Worming their way into the pipes of homes, offices and public buildings, the wipes have doubled the amount of solid waste that needs to be extracted from water treatment plants. Dave Rousse, president of the wipes trade group, insisted to the Times that users are not flushing the products properly. Outrage: New York City's water waste management has spent $18 million on wet wipes in five years. His words have been slammed by city officials - and waste water managers around the country - who insist the wipes should be disposed of in the trash. The controversy could be solved by an experiment, backed by Mayor Bill de Blasio, that will test which wipes survive the entire sewage system. If so, under a new bill, the manufacturers would be ordered to remove the term 'flushable' from its packaging.\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=128, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=False, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: [128000, 9370, 5730, 553, 279, 2768, 3754, 4652, 304, 220, 4386, 11460, 13, 5321, 2612, 279, 12399, 1193, 11, 2085, 904, 1023, 1495, 382, 17064, 512, 3648, 4356, 4409, 706, 7543, 400, 972, 3610, 304, 4330, 1667, 21482, 26330, 364, 22402, 481, 6, 14739, 84638, 505, 279, 63020, 1887, 13, 1666, 279, 3956, 617, 3719, 15098, 5526, 11, 1690, 17032, 3802, 311, 617, 364, 89171, 291, 6, 1124, 311, 6160, 536, 7082, 994, 74820, 13, 2030, 279, 3363, 596, 12571, 6373, 28454, 617, 3309, 279, 1561, 4356, 8691, 25, 430, 374, 539, 279, 1162, 13, 364, 1451, 30394, 1260, 1232, 45956, 84638, 46935, 439, 364, 22402, 481, 6, 617, 1027, 272, 26330, 709, 279, 1887, 555, 80654, 1139, 61317, 13, 3277, 279, 84638, 27744, 1139, 264, 51900, 323, 6651, 449, 63471, 477, 5707, 11, 814, 527, 2351, 750, 5278, 1257, 1260, 2965, 27158, 41443, 35407, 328, 2113, 24238, 315, 279, 6011, 315, 25027, 19721, 1071, 13, 74130, 287, 872, 1648, 1139, 279, 32275, 315, 10632, 11, 19672, 323, 586, 14016, 11, 279, 84638, 617, 35717, 279, 3392, 315, 6573, 12571, 430, 3966, 311, 387, 28532, 505, 3090, 6514, 11012, 13, 20851, 98989, 11, 4872, 315, 279, 84638, 6696, 1912, 11, 29676, 311, 279, 8691, 430, 3932, 527, 539, 91632, 279, 3956, 10489, 13, 4470, 48468, 25, 1561, 4356, 4409, 596, 3090, 12571, 6373, 706, 7543, 400, 972, 3610, 389, 14739, 84638, 304, 4330, 1667, 13, 5414, 4339, 617, 1027, 50365, 555, 3363, 7510, 482, 323, 12571, 3090, 20258, 2212, 279, 3224, 482, 889, 32262, 279, 84638, 1288, 387, 26655, 315, 304, 279, 23701, 13, 578, 26654, 1436, 387, 29056, 555, 459, 9526, 11, 22126, 555, 22868, 8766, 409, 93493, 11, 430, 690, 1296, 902, 84638, 18167, 279, 4553, 72217, 1887, 13, 1442, 779, 11, 1234, 264, 502, 4121, 11, 279, 17032, 1053, 387, 11713, 311, 4148, 279, 4751, 364, 22402, 481, 6, 505, 1202, 24066, 382, 19791, 25], prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

Christine, pictured below with husband Neil,\xa0the former Tory MP, is set to become the face of £19-per-pack SLIM-BE Shots. The powdered drink contains konjac, a jelly-like substance made from a Japanese plant, which aids weight loss by gently expanding in the stomach to give a feeling of fullness. Christine Hamilton, pictured right with her husband Neil, is set to be the face of\xa0£19-per-pack SLIM-BE Shots. Christine, 65, isn’t saying just how much money she has invested but claims the concoction helped her shed a stone three years ago – and she has kept it off. ‘I’ve had enough of beastly politics and thought I would become a businesswoman,’ she reveals. ‘Konjac has monster hunger-busting properties.’ She will be selling the product on shopping channel QVC. A device that can help GPs tell the difference between bacterial and viral infections has been welcomed by health chiefs as a way to halt the over-use of antibiotic medication. The hand-held device, the size of a rattle, contains a sensor that can analyse a nasal swab taken in the doctor’s surgery. It gives a positive reading within seconds if the patient has Influenza A or B – common flu strains in recent epidemics – or RSV, the Respiratory Syncytial Virus that is a major cause of coughs and chest infections. These do not respond to antibiotics, which target only bacterial infections. Dr Maureen Baker, chairman of the Royal College of General Practitioners, says: ‘GPs have so far had to employ a certain level of risk management when there is no certainty of the cause of illness, and are under pressure from assertive patients to prescribe. ‘However, the fact that so few new antibiotics have been developed is also an issue, as is the willingness of patients to accept that lots of bacterial infections as well as viruses will settle down on their own in a few days.’ Sex pill cools hot flushes. A natural supplement known as the ‘female Viagra’, which is designed to help women with a low sex drive, has been found to reduce symptoms in women who are on the verge of the menopause. Lady Prelox, a ‘pink pill’ containing French pine bark extract pycnogenol, combined with rose hip extract and amino acids L-Arginine and L-Citrulline, was tested on 80 women in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial at the University of Sofia in Bulgaria. A natural supplement, known as the ‘female Viagra’,  has been found to reduce symptoms in women who are on the verge of the menopause. File photo. The results found that after a month of taking the supplement four times a day, participants’ sexual appetite was boosted by 60 per cent, and by 73 per cent after two months – compared with 40 per cent and 46 per cent in the placebo group. Women also reported that hot flushes, sleep problems and cognitive issues improved. The findings were published in the Journal Of Women’s Healthcare. Families of dementia patients can see their loved ones at any time of the day or night after a hospital scrapped traditional visiting hours. Instead, relatives visiting patients at Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust in London will be issued with a special ‘carer’s passport’ to allow them to drop in outside normal hours. The move aims to help dementia patients feel more settled, as they can become confused or agitated in an unfamiliar environment. Jo James, the trust’s lead nurse on dementia, said: ‘Patients who have dementia or are vulnerable often rely on their carers to help guide them through everyday life experiences, including time spent in hospital. However, traditional visiting times do not enable carers to fulfil this important role.’ It is a part of a wider drive to improve care for dementia patients. Other measures include a weekly drop-in clinic for relatives and friends, and awareness training for all trust staff. Young diabetics get Angry. Children with diabetes are being given help to monitor their illness – with the Angry Birds game. Technology company MODZ has launched a blood glucose meter featuring the characters from the multi-million-selling app. Technology company MODZ has launched a blood glucose meter (pictured) featuring the characters from the multi-million-selling app Angry Birds. The touchscreen device motivates children affected by type 1 diabetes to take control of their health, by reminding them to test their blood glucose levels. It uses the colours of the Angry Birds characters to correspond to the child’s blood glucose levels and awards users points for good test results, allowing them to progress. Starter kits cost from £252.\n\nSummary:', params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None,

Premier League leaders Chelsea have dropped an average of just 8.6 points per season during the last 10 years. If the Blues replicate the form they have shown in their last 10 games during previous seasons then Manchester City will not be able to retain the league title even if they claim nine consecutive wins. Chelsea look set to win the 2014-15 Premier League title as the Blues tend to finish the season off in fine form. Chelsea dropped two points against Southampton at the weekend but are still odds-on favourites to win the title. Jose Mourinho insists Arsenal have joined Chelsea and Manchester City in the Premier League title race. 2013-14: 11 points dropped. 12-13: 7. 11-12: 15. 10-11: 10. 09-10: 5. 08-09: 6. 07-08: 10. 06-07: 11. 05-06: 6. Average: 8.6 points dropped. Chelsea are seven points clear of Manchester City with a game in hand of both their title rivals. Arsenal are even further behind as they are currently seven points behind Premier League leaders Chelsea, having played a game less than the Gunners. However Mourinho said after his side's 1-1 draw with Southampton: ‘Of course Arsenal are in it. They are seven points behind Chelsea, but have one less match to play than Chelsea. ‘Both City and Arsenal are in the title race. It depends on the momentum for Arsenal - the 3-1 defeat against Monaco or the 3-0 defeat against West Ham? ‘So the danger is always there. But I keep saying, we are there. If someone had told me in August that, at the end of March, we'd be six points in front with a match in hand, I'd have signed for that immediately.' Chelsea would finish the season off with over 85 points (85.4 to be exact) if history is to repeat itself - based on the average number of points they have dropped in their last 10 games of the season. The maximum amount of points Manchester City can ascertain is 85 and that would mean Manuel Pellegrini's side defeating the likes of Manchester United, Tottenham and Southampton. Arsenal, on the other hand, will be on 84 points if they win their remaining nine fixtures of the campaign. So it appears Mourinho's statement on Arsenal's title credentials may have just been a ploy to ease the pressure on his players following their draw against Southampton. Premier League champions Manchester City slipped up against Burnley at the weekend. CHELSEA. Hull (away) - March 22. Stoke (home) - April 4. QPR (away) - April 12. Man United (home) - April 18.

David Cameron's daughter Nancy, 11, ‘threatened to go on hunger strike’ unless Jeremy Clarkson is restored as Top Gear host. Despite the 'threat', which her parents have joked about, Nancy appeared to be enjoying dinner with her family. The PM told the BBC: ‘Nancy has threatened to go on hunger strike unless Jeremy Clarkson is restored. ‘I’ve told her this is not necessarily a useful intervention. It’s not exactly Gandhi, we had a discussion about this this morning.’ Samantha Cameron chipped in: ‘Nancy’s hunger strike this morning lasted approximately five minutes’. The Prime Minister quipped: ‘It’s between lunch and tea is the way it works.’ During the interview, Mr Cameron and BBC Political Editor James Landale went to a local butcher near his constituency home in Witney, Oxfordshire. They then went back to Mr Cameron’s home where the PM was interviewed while preparing food in his kitchen. Clarkson was suspended two weeks ago following allegations of 'a fracas' with Top Gear producer Oisin Tymon (right), prompting the top-rating show to be pulled off air. Nancy's siblings Florence (left) and Elwen tuck into a dinner of cold meats and a healthy salad, prepared by Mr Cameron. Mr Cameron was seen visiting a butchers shop in his Witney constituency, and joking about 'juicy thighs' In the shop, Mr Cameron chose some chicken, saying: ‘I like the thighs because they’re very juicy.’ He also denied being the shop’s most famous customer, pointing out ‘Mr Clarkson pops in from time to time doesn’t he?’. Mr Cameron said it was very important to him that his children ‘feel very rooted and grounded’ in Oxfordshire. One of his children, he said, calls 10 Downing Street ‘the pretend home’. The interview appeared to show Mr Cameron’s kitchen contains a red chopping board emblazoned with ‘Calm Down Dear’ The PM was accused of sexism in 2011 after using that slogan, taken from a TV advert, against Labour front bencher Angela Eagle. Mr Cameron has previously said his children would be ‘heartbroken’ if Top Gear was taken off air. When details of the incident emerged, he backed calls for Mr Clarkson to be reinstated. ‘Because he is such a huge talent and he amuses and entertains so many people, including my children, who’d be heartbroken if Top Gear was taken off air, I hope this can be sorted out,’ he said.\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=128, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=False, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: [128000, 9370, 5730, 553, 279, 2768, 3754, 4652, 304, 220, 4386, 11460, 13, 5321, 2612, 279, 12399, 1193, 11, 2085, 904, 1023, 1495, 382, 17064, 512, 45, 6709, 27524, 3451, 97229, 6901, 311, 733, 389, 34906, 13471, 529, 7389, 28217, 94294, 374, 28101, 439, 7054, 28603, 3552, 11, 1077, 7126, 68329, 13985, 13, 6941, 27524, 1071, 813, 220, 806, 4771, 6418, 10003, 574, 55927, 2403, 279, 18588, 753, 5597, 311, 27343, 279, 34756, 927, 264, 3451, 38118, 300, 529, 449, 264, 17276, 13, 4491, 94294, 374, 459, 26275, 15255, 22686, 323, 3070, 4333, 315, 279, 8215, 261, 2439, 13, 23198, 1523, 369, 2835, 13, 6941, 27524, 596, 10003, 35336, 11, 220, 806, 11, 3451, 97229, 6901, 311, 733, 389, 34906, 13471, 529, 7389, 28217, 94294, 374, 28101, 439, 7054, 28603, 3552, 13, 18185, 279, 364, 97229, 518, 902, 1077, 6699, 617, 68329, 922, 11, 35336, 9922, 311, 387, 22128, 14177, 449, 1077, 3070, 13, 578, 5975, 3309, 279, 18588, 25, 3451, 45, 6709, 706, 21699, 311, 733, 389, 34906, 13471, 7389, 28217, 94294, 374, 28101, 13, 3451, 40, 4070, 3309, 1077, 420, 374, 539, 14647, 264, 5505, 21623, 13, 1102, 753, 539, 7041, 48994, 11, 584, 1047, 264, 10430, 922, 420, 420, 6693, 14639, 63908, 27524, 523, 6586, 304, 25, 3451, 45, 6709, 753, 34906, 13471, 420, 6693, 36513, 13489, 4330, 4520, 24535, 578, 12801, 9675, 934, 6586, 25, 3451, 2181, 753, 1990, 16163, 323, 15600, 374, 279, 1648, 433, 4375, 14639, 12220, 279, 7274, 11, 4491, 27524, 323, 18588, 31597, 12865, 7957, 11680, 1604, 4024, 311, 264, 2254, 76194, 3221, 813, 65739, 2162, 304, 72959, 3520, 11, 26275, 15255, 13, 2435, 1243, 4024, 1203, 311, 4491, 27524, 753, 2162, 1405, 279, 5975, 574, 30147, 1418, 20646, 3691, 304, 813, 9979, 13, 94294, 574, 22340, 1403, 5672, 4227, 2768, 18873, 315, 364, 64, 54776, 300, 6, 449, 7054, 28603, 17276, 507, 58504, 350, 1631, 263, 320, 1315, 705, 50745, 279, 1948, 80611, 1501, 311, 387, 13541, 1022, 3805, 13, 35336, 596, 37783, 48606, 320, 2414, 8, 323, 4072, 17378, 259, 1983, 1139, 264, 14177, 315, 9439, 63875, 323, 264, 9498, 33566, 11, 10235, 555, 4491, 27524, 13, 4491, 27524, 574, 3970, 17136, 264, 719, 99723, 8221, 304, 813, 72959, 3520, 65739, 11, 323, 58134, 922, 364, 8783, 2912, 60611, 6, 763, 279, 8221, 11, 4491, 27524, 14896, 1063, 16553, 11, 5605, 25, 3451, 40, 1093, 279, 60611, 1606, 814, 3207, 1633, 56153, 14639, 1283, 1101, 15164, 1694, 279, 8221, 753, 1455, 11495, 6130, 11, 22364, 704, 3451, 12555, 94294, 48700, 304, 505, 892, 311, 892, 3250, 1431, 568, 30, 24535, 4491, 27524, 1071, 433, 574, 1633, 3062, 311, 1461, 430, 813, 2911, 3451, 57676, 1633, 41976, 323, 45445, 529, 304, 26275, 15255, 13, 3861, 315, 813, 2911, 11, 568, 1071, 11, 6880, 220, 605, 84779, 6825, 3451, 1820, 35840, 2162, 24535, 578, 7274, 9922, 311, 1501, 4491, 27524, 753, 9979, 5727, 264, 2579, 97387, 4580, 991, 2067, 5639, 291, 449, 3451, 34, 7828, 6419, 43922, 529, 578, 5975, 574, 13487, 315, 69095, 304, 220, 679, 16, 1306, 1701, 430, 52637, 11, 4529, 505, 264, 6007, 7845, 11, 2403, 18993, 4156, 3399, 9211, 38243, 36895, 13, 4491, 27524, 706, 8767, 1071, 813, 2911, 1053, 387, 3451, 18207, 50009, 529, 422, 7054, 28603, 574, 4529, 1022, 3805, 13, 3277, 3649, 315, 279, 10672, 22763, 11, 568, 22126, 6880, 369, 4491, 94294, 311, 387, 69767, 660, 13, 3451, 18433, 568, 374, 1778, 264, 6908, 11005, 323, 568, 1097, 4881, 323, 23737, 1771, 779, 1690, 1274, 11, 2737, 856, 2911, 11, 889, 7070, 387, 4851, 50009, 422, 7054, 28603, 574, 4529, 1022, 3805, 11, 358, 3987, 420, 649, 387, 10839, 704, 23189, 568, 1071, 382, 19791, 25], prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

Joseph Torrez passed away two years ago, aged 41, after succumbing to Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, an incurable neurological disorder. The rapidly-progressing terminal illness eats away at the brain - causing dementia, memory loss, anxiety and psychosis - and affects motor skills and physical movements. Rowan Torrez, now 10, received the postcard (pictured) in the mail at the weekend, almost exactly two years after his father's death. Rowan and his father Joseph play together when he was a toddler. The young boy was his father's pride and joy, his mother Julie Van Stone said. Rowan (pictured) said he remembers his father as a'very good person' Prior to the onset of the deadly disease, he moved away from his son Rowan, 10, to Boston, to gain two Masters degrees at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 9News reported. And while studying or travelling home, he sent countless postcards to his only son reminding him how much he missed him. Now, just days away from the two-year anniversary of his death, his son Rowan has received an incredible gift in the mail. It was a postcard, dated June 10, 2007, which read: 'Hello from Pennsylvania. I love you, and I miss you so much. See you soon. Love, Daddy.' It was a touching moment for Rowan, who remembers his father as a'very good person' and a good father and, as he told the broadcaster, a fitting final goodbye.\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=128, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=False, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: [128000, 9370, 5730, 553, 279, 2768, 3754, 4652, 304, 220, 4386, 11460, 13, 5321, 2612, 279, 12399, 1193, 11, 2085, 904, 1023, 1495, 382, 17064, 512, 11874, 1667, 1306, 813, 4648, 11, 264, 23649, 27744, 315, 25382, 706, 8967, 264, 21955, 19574, 7126, 596, 1984, 706, 5616, 8813, 813, 220, 605, 4771, 6418, 4538, 13, 15466, 8611, 23577, 5946, 3201, 1403, 1667, 4227, 11, 20330, 220, 3174, 11, 1306, 20639, 33546, 311, 7948, 34097, 31202, 83, 12278, 587, 677, 8624, 11, 459, 62622, 481, 64908, 19823, 13, 578, 19019, 54391, 287, 15372, 17563, 50777, 3201, 520, 279, 8271, 482, 14718, 52857, 11, 5044, 4814, 11, 18547, 323, 98147, 482, 323, 22223, 9048, 7512, 323, 7106, 19567, 13, 11035, 276, 8611, 23577, 11, 1457, 220, 605, 11, 4036, 279, 1772, 5057, 320, 69389, 8, 304, 279, 8232, 520, 279, 9178, 11, 4661, 7041, 1403, 1667, 1306, 813, 7126, 596, 4648, 13, 11035, 276, 323, 813, 7126, 15466, 1514, 3871, 994, 568, 574, 264, 52335, 13, 578, 3995, 8334, 574, 813, 7126, 596, 22519, 323, 16267, 11, 813, 6691, 42287, 13000, 14637, 1071, 13, 11035, 276, 320, 69389, 8, 1071, 568, 43457, 813, 7126, 439, 264, 3077, 894, 1695, 1732, 6, 32499, 311, 279, 42080, 315, 279, 25114, 8624, 11, 568, 7882, 3201, 505, 813, 4538, 11035, 276, 11, 220, 605, 11, 311, 10406, 11, 311, 8895, 1403, 34722, 12628, 520, 279, 22108, 10181, 315, 12053, 11, 220, 24, 14710, 5068, 13, 1628, 1418, 21630, 477, 31829, 2162, 11, 568, 3288, 28701, 1772, 26076, 311, 813, 1193, 4538, 64042, 1461, 1268, 1790, 568, 13942, 1461, 13, 4800, 11, 1120, 2919, 3201, 505, 279, 1403, 4771, 22310, 315, 813, 4648, 11, 813, 4538, 11035, 276, 706, 4036, 459, 15400, 8352, 304, 279, 8232, 13, 1102, 574, 264, 1772, 5057, 11, 30105, 5651, 220, 605, 11, 220, 1049, 22, 11, 902, 1373, 25, 364, 9906, 505, 20355, 13, 358, 3021, 499, 11, 323, 358, 3194, 499, 779, 1790, 13, 3580, 499, 5246, 13, 10919, 11, 54546, 3238, 1102, 574, 264, 31687, 4545, 369, 11035, 276, 11, 889, 43457, 813, 7126, 439, 264, 3077, 894, 1695, 1732, 6, 323, 264, 1695, 7126, 323, 11, 439, 568, 3309, 279, 60983, 11, 264, 27442, 1620, 47555, 382, 19791, 25], prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

Picked by Steven Gerrard to play up front in the All-Star charity game against Jamie Carragher's side, the Spaniard will partner Luis Suarez. Torres struck up a close relationship with the Liverpool captain during his days at the club and he's excited to be returning for this special occasion. Atletico Madrid striker Fernando Torres (centre) is excited to be returning to Anfield for the All-Star game. Speaking to Liverpool's club website he said: 'I'm really looking forward to meeting some of my old team-mates, especially Stevie. I'm sure it's going to be a great day and night for him. And also to meet Liverpool fans again; many times I have been back to Anfield as an opponent, but this time I'm going like part of the home team. It's going to be a really emotional day for me.' The Atletico player says he's fully behind the cause and is looking forward to helping Gerrard out. 'My first reaction was: 'Of course I will be there. I will do anything I can, anything in my hands, to be there with Stevie on that day.' The Spaniard had an incredible few seasons at Liverpool and became one of the best forwards in the world. Liverpool fans will be drooling over the prospect that two of their best forwards in recent years will be partnering up and Torres admits he can't wait to play alongside Luis Suarez. He said: 'I saw what Luis did in his time at Liverpool and it was amazing, just amazing. Luis is a good friend - we have a good relationship and good friendship. We were sitting together for two days at Melwood when I was leaving and he was coming. 'We made good friends and we are still in touch now. I also know what it means to him to go back to Anfield and play there again. It will be great to play up front with him, especially with Stevie G behind us.' The 31-year-old's move to Chelsea didn't work out and he was booed on his last return to the club. In his previous returns to Anfield, Torres was greeted with a chorus of boos - with some fans still upset after he moved to Premier League rivals Chelsea. But the 31-year-old was quick to play down the boos and praised Liverpool's fans. He revealed: 'I will say to everybody that what the media says about the relationship between Liverpool fans and me after I left was not the reality. Everybody knows the kind of reaction Liverpool fans had when we met on the street in London or when I went back to Liverpool - everybody gave me thanks for everything I did in Liverpool. Torres could feature up top alongside his friend Luis Suarez who left the club for Barcelona in the summer. 'That is what I feel for them. For me, Liverpool fans are always going to be different; I had probably the best period of my career wearing the red shirt and all my memories are great. I have nothing bad to say about them and I never will - they treated me like one of them and I felt at home in my time there. 'It is going to be amazing going back; hopefully the reception will be better than the one I had when I went with Chelsea. But it doesn't matter what happens really. Liverpool fans are part of my heart and my feelings - everything I felt when I was a Liverpool player is inside me and no-one is going to take that away from me.' Steven Gerrard (right) and Torres struck up a friendship during his time and are still in contact with eachother. He soon became a Kop hero after his move to Merseyside and Torres would love to score in front of the fans once again - and admits he wouldn't hold back. 'If I could do that, I would celebrate like if I was scoring in a Liverpool shirt,' he said. 'There are many memories, nice memories - great nights, great games, many goals scored in front of the Kop - and they made me feel like I could fly. I'm sure if I could score a goal, I can remember that kind of situation and try to enjoy it and celebrate like it's an official game.' Torres and Gerrard formed a formdiable partnership and relationship on the pitch, which Torres hasn't forgotten - labelling the captain as the best player he played with. The Liverpool captain was described as the best player Torres has played with during his football career. 'I can't wait to play with Stevie again. I just wanted to have the chance to play with him, even if it is just one last time. No-one knows if it is going to be the last time, but be sure that I am going to enjoy it. 'I have said many times that Stevie is the best player that I have played with - by far. He was a big influence for me as a player; I had one career before I started playing with him and one career after I played with him. He changed my game and changed my motivation and ambition. 'He made me feel that I could really do whatever I wanted. For me, he is going to be the best forever, so to have the chance to play with him on a special day like it is going to be on Sunday, is a privilege. I want to be there on Sunday and be on the pitch with him.'\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0,

Please output the summary only, without any other text.\n\nArticle:\nA bus station which was dubbed the\'mouth of hell\' by Grand Designs presenter Kevin McCloud will be demolished tomorrow. Greyfriars bus station in Northampton, East Midlands, opened nearly 40 years ago but after a new terminal was opened in the town last year the \'infamously ugly\' building has lain redundant. It faced criticism soon after it opened in 1976 after mineral stalactites began forming inside and in 2005 it was voted third in a list of 12 buildings that should be demolished for a Channel 4 series. Greyfriars bus station in Northampton, East Midlands, opened in 1976 but will be reduced to rubble tomorrow. The programme, titled Demolition, was fronted by broadcaster McCloud when he compared the building to the\'mouth of hell\'. It was described in the Lonely Planet guide as \'infamously ugly\'. There were also concerns for the safety of the bus station after two people died when they were hit by buses inside the station in the 2000s. Kevin McCloud once described the building as the\'mouth of hell\' on Channel 4\'s Demolition show. The three-storey building, which includes a car park and offices which have not been used for years, will be reduced to rubble tomorrow by demolition specialist DSM, which will \'blow it down\'. David Macintosh, leader of Northampton Borough Council, said: \'It\'s funny because in the last couple of months, people have said "We will miss it." \'It\'s not very well-liked, and is now redundant. "The mouth of hell\' sums it up perfectly." Alan Carr, who spent some of his childhood in Northampton, wrote on Twitter: \'Is that smelly cafe still there in the basement in Greyfriars bus station? You\'d see people dry heaving before they got on their buses.\' The four-acre site takes up a large part of the town centre, and the council has set up an exclusion zone - and is evacuating 414 nearby homes as a precaution. Northampton Borough Council is live-streaming the demolition of the building, and urged spectators to watch it online rather than in person. The council said the structure is costing taxpayers £500,000 in repairs every year, and it would take almost £30 million to renovate. Its demolition is part of Northampton\'s regeneration programme and plans for new retail and leisure schemes are being considered. The town\'s new bus station has also had its problems with police being called in to direct traffic after queues of buses formed.\n\nSummary:', params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=128, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=False, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: [128000, 9370, 5730, 553, 279, 2768, 3754, 4652, 304, 220, 4386, 11460, 13, 5321, 2612, 279, 12399, 1193, 11, 2085, 904, 1023, 1495, 382, 17064, 512, 32, 5951, 8216, 902, 574, 42160, 279, 2846, 2969, 315, 15123, 6, 555, 10517, 44366, 34756, 16768, 4584, 16440, 690, 387, 76993, 16986, 13, 26769, 69, 462, 1590, 5951, 8216, 304, 4892, 43101, 11, 6460, 81251, 11, 9107, 7154, 220, 1272, 1667, 4227, 719, 1306, 264, 502, 15372, 574, 9107, 304, 279, 6424, 1566, 1060, 279, 364, 13885, 309, 7162, 28360, 6, 4857, 706, 51476, 48832, 13, 1102, 17011, 19347, 5246, 1306, 433, 9107, 304, 220, 4468, 21, 1306, 25107, 80576, 533, 3695, 6137, 30164, 4871, 323, 304, 220, 1049, 20, 433, 574, 16626, 4948, 304, 264, 1160, 315, 220, 717, 14016, 430, 1288, 387, 76993, 369, 264, 13740, 220, 19, 4101, 13, 26769, 69, 462, 1590, 5951, 8216, 304, 4892, 43101, 11, 6460, 81251, 11, 9107, 304, 220, 4468, 21, 719, 690, 387, 11293, 311, 74535, 16986, 13, 578, 18629, 11, 25891, 4829, 337, 684, 11, 574, 4156, 291, 555, 60983, 4584, 16440, 994, 568, 7863, 279, 4857, 311, 279, 2846, 2969, 315, 15123, 4527, 1102, 574, 7633, 304, 279, 86823, 29935, 8641, 439, 364, 13885, 309, 7162, 28360, 4527, 2684, 1051, 1101, 10742, 369, 279, 7296, 315, 279, 5951, 8216, 1306, 1403, 1274, 8636, 994, 814, 1051, 4295, 555, 34480, 4871, 279, 8216, 304, 279, 220, 1049, 15, 82, 13, 16768, 4584, 16440, 3131, 7633, 279, 4857, 439, 279, 2846, 2969, 315, 15123, 6, 389, 13740, 220, 19, 596, 4829, 337, 684, 1501, 13, 578, 2380, 34352, 88, 4857, 11, 902, 5764, 264, 1841, 6246, 323, 19672, 902, 617, 539, 1027, 1511, 369, 1667, 11, 690, 387, 11293, 311, 74535, 16986, 555, 61698, 24687, 80267, 11, 902, 690, 364, 2067, 363, 433, 1523, 4527, 6941, 7553, 62694, 11, 7808, 315, 4892, 43101, 85303, 9251, 11, 1071, 25, 364, 2181, 596, 15526, 1606, 304, 279, 1566, 5743, 315, 4038, 11, 1274, 617, 1071, 330, 1687, 690, 3194, 433, 1210, 364, 2181, 596, 539, 1633, 1664, 12, 44336, 11, 323, 374, 1457, 48832, 13, 330, 791, 11013, 315, 15123, 6, 37498, 433, 709, 14268, 1210, 26349, 30474, 11, 889, 7543, 1063, 315, 813, 20587, 304, 4892, 43101, 11, 6267, 389, 6405, 25, 364, 3957, 430, 1554, 12160, 42030, 2103, 1070, 304, 279, 31741, 304, 26769, 69, 462, 1590, 5951, 8216, 30, 1472, 4265, 1518, 1274, 9235, 568, 2370, 1603, 814, 2751, 389, 872, 34480, 3238, 578, 3116, 64434, 2816, 5097, 709, 264, 3544, 961, 315, 279, 6424, 12541, 11, 323, 279, 15177, 706, 743, 709, 459, 42308, 10353, 482, 323, 374, 30520, 54643, 220, 17448, 14373, 10632, 439, 264, 72147, 13, 4892, 43101, 85303, 9251, 374, 3974, 39823, 287, 279, 61698, 315, 279, 4857, 11, 323, 28932, 70402, 311, 3821, 433, 2930, 4856, 1109, 304, 1732, 13, 578, 15177, 1071, 279, 6070, 374, 54824, 35748, 7083, 2636, 11, 931, 304, 31286, 1475, 1060, 11, 323, 433, 1053, 1935, 4661, 7083, 966, 3610, 311, 32652, 349, 13, 11699, 61698, 374, 961, 315, 4892, 43101, 596, 60517, 18629, 323, 6787, 369, 502, 11040, 323, 41308, 31956, 527, 1694, 6646, 13, 578, 6424, 596, 502, 5951, 8216, 706, 1101, 1047, 1202, 5435, 449, 4379, 1694, 2663, 304, 311, 2167, 9629, 1306, 49194, 315, 34480, 14454, 382, 19791, 25], prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

But the cases and their circumstances are different, very different. Friday\'s death of Tony Robinson, an unarmed biracial 19-year-old, has made Madison the latest epicenter of protests of black males killed by white officers. Eight years ago, it was a different story. Kenny shot and killed a man who pointed a pellet gun at him. He was exonerated of any wrongdoing and received a commendation.  The dead man was white. It started as a 911 call.  The caller reported a man with a gun on his front porch. What the dispatcher didn\'t know was the man that Ronald Brandon was talking about was himself. Three officers rushed to the scene, including Kenny.  They knew they were facing a potentially life-threatening situation. They were unaware that Brandon\'s ex-wife, Susan, was also calling 911. "My ex-husband is sitting outside and I think he just called 911," she said.  "He\'s got a pellet gun... He\'s drunk." As she talked to the dispatcher, the squad cars arrived outside. "I think he called you because he wants to end his drunkenness," Brandon said.  "I hear the sirens coming.  Jesus criminy.  It\'s not a real gun.  I think he wants to be taken away." The officers never learned that the weapon Ronald Brandon pointed at them was a pellet gun.  The call with that information came 40 seconds before they arrived. Kenny shot him dead. Investigators ruled the shooting a "suicide by cop." For his handling of the incident, Kenny was awarded the medal of valor, the department\'s highest honor. Last week\'s shooting hasn\'t earned commendations.  It\'s polarized a community. Because Robinson did not have a weapon, his death spurred memories of other unarmed black men killed by police: Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. Eric Garner in Staten Island, New York. Over the weekend, protesters filled streets in Madison. On Monday, demonstrators packed the Wisconsin State Capitol. They chanted and carried a banner with a familiar message: "Black lives matter." The incident started Friday night when authorities got a call that a black male was yelling and jumping in front of cars, Madison Police Chief Mike Koval said. When Kenny went to the apartment where the report came from, he heard some commotion and forced his way in, Koval said. "Once inside the home the subject involved in this incident -- the same one allegedly out in traffic and that had battered someone -- assaulted my officer," Koval said. After that, according to the chief, "The officer did draw his revolver and subsequently shot the subject." Kenny has been placed on paid administrative leave pending an investigation. "It\'s a stressful period for him and his family, but he also understands that a family here has suffered a tragic loss and he understands that there has to be an investigation," said James Palmer, executive director of the Wisconsin Professional Police Association. Under Wisconsin law, officer-involved shootings are investigated by an outside agency, in this case the Division of Criminal Investigation. Once the division completes its investigation, the report will go to the local district attorney, Koval said. Palmer declined to comment on the ongoing investigation, but said there are some circumstances when an unarmed person could still be seen as posing a deadly threat to a police officer. "The real fear for any officer when he\'s being attacked, generally speaking, is that their weapon will be taken away," Palmer said, "and an unarmed individual can become armed very quickly." Concern is a word often used by the police chief as the investigation continues. Concern for his officer.  Concern for the community. Kenny, 45, is a 12-year veteran of the Madison Police Department. Koval calls him "a very conscientious dedicated public servant," but acknowledges that a second shooting in eight-year\'s time is, well, concerning. "Any loss of life is very tragic," the chief said.  "Twice is concerning for anyone. We are concerned for him and the community." And the community is looking for its concerns to be addressed.

Shoichet and AnneClaire Stapleton contributed to this report.\n\nSummary:', params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0,

In safe hands: A chimpanzee who was allegedly left isolated in a 'hell hole' for years has finally found romance after being rescued and re-homed. Perfect match: Keepers at the 150-acre Save the Chimps sanctuary in Fort Pierce, Florida, say it was 'love at first sight' when 32-year-old Iris clapped eyes on 40-year-old Abdul last month. In March 2015 Iris was retrieved from a roadside zoo in Georgia following an undercover PETA investigation. She had reportedly been kept alone in a 'tiny, barren, and dark cell' for three years. With virtually nothing to do, she allegedly resorted to smearing her own feces on the walls of her enclosure and spent most of her time huddled under a dirty blanket. She was also pale, overweight and her legs were underdeveloped because of a lack of opportunity to exercise. The look of love: Apparently Iris and Abdul have been inseparable and heartwarming footage shows the pair lovingly kissing each other. After being transferred to the Save the Chimps facility, Iris was given immediate treatment. A few days later, when vets had given her the all-clear, she was introduced to her next-door neighbor, Abdul. Recalling the couple's first meeting, a spokesperson from Save the Chimps said: 'She kissed him and he groomed her.' Over the coming weeks Iris will be introduced to more chimpanzees as she gains confidence. Save the Chimps is currently home to more than 250 rescued chimpanzees. Some were in labs, some were in roadside zoos, and some had been neglected, abused or traumatized for years. Former home: In March 2015 Iris was retrieved from a roadside zoo in Georgia following an undercover PETA investigation - this shot allegedly shows her former cell. Distressing state: With virtually nothing to do, Iris reportedly resorted to smearing her own feces on the walls of her enclosure and spent most of her time huddled under a dirty blanket. The inhabitants munch their way through around 1,300 bananas each day. PETA is currently seeking legal action against Iris' previous owners for animal cruelty. However, they deny any wrongdoing. The park operators told NBC News that the chimp was 'well cared for' and 'doted on by humans' during her stay. Commenting on Iris' story, Molly Polidoroff who runs Save the Chimps, said: 'Of course, there will be many more adjustments and introductions as she becomes used to her new home. 'New faces, new friends, and best of all, life outdoors!'\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=128, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=False, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: [128000, 9370, 5730, 553, 279, 2768, 3754, 4652, 304, 220, 4386, 11460, 13, 5321, 2612, 279, 12399, 1193, 11, 2085, 904, 1023, 1495, 382, 17064, 512, 32, 99425, 99066, 889, 574, 19755, 220, 2163, 25181, 304, 264, 364, 57195, 31520, 6, 369, 1667, 706, 5616, 1766, 30363, 1306, 1694, 45433, 323, 312, 2902, 25111, 13, 13969, 388, 520, 279, 220, 3965, 64434, 10467, 279, 921, 67758, 51639, 304, 11246, 50930, 11, 9784, 11, 2019, 433, 574, 364, 31153, 520, 1176, 14254, 6, 994, 220, 843, 4771, 6418, 66821, 1206, 5795, 6548, 389, 220, 1272, 4771, 6418, 52698, 1566, 2305, 13, 41974, 279, 6857, 617, 1027, 54682, 50256, 323, 4851, 86, 34002, 22609, 5039, 279, 6857, 21955, 398, 52146, 1855, 1023, 13, 23198, 1523, 369, 2835, 13, 763, 6220, 6206, 25, 362, 99425, 99066, 889, 574, 19755, 2163, 25181, 304, 264, 364, 57195, 14512, 6, 369, 1667, 706, 5616, 1766, 30363, 1306, 1694, 45433, 323, 312, 2902, 25111, 13, 24118, 2489, 25, 13969, 388, 520, 279, 220, 3965, 64434, 10467, 279, 921, 67758, 51639, 304, 11246, 50930, 11, 9784, 11, 2019, 433, 574, 364, 31153, 520, 1176, 14254, 6, 994, 220, 843, 4771, 6418, 66821, 1206, 5795, 6548, 389, 220, 1272, 4771, 6418, 52698, 1566, 2305, 13, 763, 5587, 220, 679, 20, 66821, 574, 31503, 505, 264, 80743, 42014, 304, 16272, 2768, 459, 58581, 393, 21352, 8990, 13, 3005, 1047, 18307, 1027, 8774, 7636, 304, 264, 364, 47216, 11, 95088, 11, 323, 6453, 2849, 6, 369, 2380, 1667, 13, 3161, 21907, 4400, 311, 656, 11, 1364, 19755, 594, 13909, 311, 1554, 13992, 1077, 1866, 55061, 288, 389, 279, 14620, 315, 1077, 58912, 323, 7543, 1455, 315, 1077, 892, 305, 85201, 1234, 264, 19108, 39139, 13, 3005, 574, 1101, 28639, 11, 50254, 323, 1077, 14535, 1051, 1234, 16219, 291, 1606, 315, 264, 6996, 315, 6776, 311, 10368, 13, 578, 1427, 315, 3021, 25, 41974, 66821, 323, 52698, 617, 1027, 54682, 50256, 323, 4851, 86, 34002, 22609, 5039, 279, 6857, 21955, 398, 52146, 1855, 1023, 13, 4740, 1694, 23217, 311, 279, 10467, 279, 921, 67758, 12764, 11, 66821, 574, 2728, 14247, 6514, 13, 362, 2478, 2919, 3010, 11, 994, 98118, 1047, 2728, 1077, 279, 682, 68127, 11, 1364, 574, 11784, 311, 1077, 1828, 58190, 9760, 11, 52698, 13, 4158, 17157, 279, 5743, 596, 1176, 6574, 11, 264, 29003, 505, 10467, 279, 921, 67758, 1071, 25, 364, 8100, 59334, 1461, 323, 568, 40941, 291, 1077, 3238, 6193, 279, 5108, 5672, 66821, 690, 387, 11784, 311, 810, 99425, 3059, 288, 439, 1364, 20192, 12410, 13, 10467, 279, 921, 67758, 374, 5131, 2162, 311, 810, 1109, 220, 5154, 45433, 99425, 3059, 288, 13, 4427, 1051, 304, 51048, 11, 1063, 1051, 304, 80743, 19263, 437, 11, 323, 1063, 1047, 1027, 51533, 11, 36665, 477, 99136, 1534, 369, 1667, 13, 33600, 2162, 25, 763, 5587, 220, 679, 20, 66821, 574, 31503, 505, 264, 80743, 42014, 304, 16272, 2768, 459, 58581, 393, 21352, 8990, 482, 420, 6689, 19755, 5039, 1077, 4846, 2849, 13, 28704, 57881, 1614, 25, 3161, 21907, 4400, 311, 656, 11, 66821, 18307, 594, 13909, 311, 1554, 13992, 1077, 1866, 55061, 288, 389, 279, 14620, 315, 1077, 58912, 323, 7543, 1455, 315, 1077, 892, 305, 85201, 1234, 264, 19108, 39139, 13, 578, 40771, 99345, 872, 1648, 1555, 2212, 220, 16, 11, 3101, 68442, 1855, 1938, 13, 393, 21352, 374, 5131, 11125, 5897, 1957, 2403, 66821, 6, 3766, 7980, 369, 10065, 54680, 13, 4452, 11, 814, 23973, 904, 65328, 13, 578, 6246, 20197, 3309, 24426, 5513, 430, 279, 523, 6802, 574, 364, 9336, 42777, 369, 6, 323, 364, 67, 9437, 389, 555, 12966, 6, 2391, 1077, 4822, 13, 12535, 287, 389, 66821, 6, 3446, 11, 58500, 3735, 29856, 1885, 889, 8640, 10467, 279, 921, 67758, 11, 1071, 25, 364, 2173, 3388, 11, 1070, 690, 387, 1690, 810, 34074, 323, 6111, 5247, 439, 1364, 9221, 1511, 311, 1077, 502, 2162, 13, 364, 3648, 12580, 11, 502, 4885, 11, 323, 1888, 315, 682, 11, 2324, 34632, 0, 3961, 19791, 25], prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

Bryan Santana of Orlando, Florida, who is accused of killing\xa0Shelby\xa0Fazio and her dog last October, has been ordered to undergo a mental evaluation by the judge in the case. This after Santana's lawyer\xa0argued\xa0that he is not competent to stand trial following an\xa0incident\xa0earlier in the day\xa0where he smeared feces all over himself and tried to hit a corrections officer at the courthouse. Scroll down for video. Bryan Santana (left) of Orlando, Florida has been charged with murder in the death of his former roommate Shelby Fazio (right) He is also charged with attempted murder for allegedly attacking their third roommate with a knife and killing Fazio's dog (above) 'He has now soiled himself and smeared himself in feces and smeared the wall, said Judge Renee Roache after the incident, according to WKMG. 'I've ordered security to clean him up and bring him up here in full restraints.' And while she is allowing two doctors to examine the young man, she has made it clear that she has no time for this\xa0behavior. 'He certainly knows how to behave himself in the courtroom. He behaved himself very well yesterday. Now that the train is coming down the tracks at full speed, we are seeing some other behavior,' she said. 'I will not tolerate disruption in this courtroom. If I have to gag him, I will. If I have to remove him I will.' Testimony has now been pushed back to begin on Wednesday morning as Santana, 21, faces murder charges for allegedly\xa0strangling\xa0Fazio with a belt before stabbing her in the neck with a pen and the having sex\xa0with her corpse. In earlier court documents, Santana confessed to the\xa0strangling, stabbing and sexual intercourse. He also allegedly killed Fazio's dog and wrote out 'I'm sorry I did this' in animal blood on a wall. In court documents, Santana (right) admitted to strangling and stabbing Fazio (left), a Disney World employee, to death, and then having sex with her corpse. This after Fazio, 23, had moved in with the young man to begin a job at Disney World. The two had a third roommate who Santana also allegedly tried to kill, and for which he faces an\xa0attempted\xa0murder charge. That roommate claims Santana pepper sprayed them and came at them with a knife. After the incident, Santana is believed to have taken Fazio's car and tried to go to a Walmart to buy a toy gun in hopes that he would be shot dead pointing it at police. He also went and got a haircut. Friends say the young man no longer wanted to live.\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=128, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=False, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: [128000, 9370, 5730, 553, 279, 2768, 3754, 4652, 304, 220, 4386, 11460, 13, 5321, 2612, 279, 12399, 1193, 11, 2085, 904, 1023, 1495, 382, 17064, 512, 791, 9269, 315, 264, 23317, 9889, 8334, 889, 706, 1027, 11684, 449, 47305, 2785, 813, 70414, 1603, 72022, 1077, 323, 1243, 3515, 1877, 449, 1077, 52644, 706, 1027, 23540, 13, 37453, 92795, 315, 28944, 11, 9784, 11, 889, 374, 13487, 315, 13419, 4194, 2059, 301, 1729, 117899, 57946, 323, 1077, 5679, 1566, 6664, 11, 706, 1027, 11713, 311, 37771, 264, 10723, 16865, 555, 279, 11913, 304, 279, 1162, 13, 1115, 1306, 92795, 596, 15779, 4194, 867, 3340, 4194, 9210, 568, 374, 539, 40883, 311, 2559, 9269, 2768, 459, 4194, 76111, 4194, 686, 5741, 304, 279, 1938, 4194, 2940, 568, 91567, 1636, 55061, 288, 682, 927, 5678, 323, 6818, 311, 4295, 264, 51479, 9640, 520, 279, 82132, 13, 23198, 1523, 369, 2835, 13, 37453, 92795, 320, 2414, 8, 315, 28944, 11, 9784, 706, 1027, 11684, 449, 10102, 304, 279, 4648, 315, 813, 4846, 70414, 70508, 435, 57946, 320, 1315, 8, 1283, 374, 1101, 11684, 449, 17644, 10102, 369, 19755, 23664, 872, 4948, 70414, 449, 264, 22145, 323, 13419, 435, 57946, 596, 5679, 320, 49532, 8, 364, 1548, 706, 1457, 779, 2230, 5678, 323, 91567, 1636, 5678, 304, 55061, 288, 323, 91567, 1636, 279, 7147, 11, 1071, 20819, 67527, 68, 12093, 1815, 1306, 279, 10672, 11, 4184, 311, 68450, 33039, 13, 364, 40, 3077, 11713, 4868, 311, 4335, 1461, 709, 323, 4546, 1461, 709, 1618, 304, 2539, 312, 7610, 3238, 1628, 1418, 1364, 374, 10923, 1403, 16410, 311, 21635, 279, 3995, 893, 11, 1364, 706, 1903, 433, 2867, 430, 1364, 706, 912, 892, 369, 420, 4194, 56966, 13, 364, 1548, 7995, 8964, 1268, 311, 36792, 5678, 304, 279, 59220, 13, 1283, 89831, 5678, 1633, 1664, 13985, 13, 4800, 430, 279, 5542, 374, 5108, 1523, 279, 14242, 520, 2539, 4732, 11, 584, 527, 9298, 1063, 1023, 7865, 2965, 1364, 1071, 13, 364, 40, 690, 539, 50134, 44219, 304, 420, 59220, 13, 1442, 358, 617, 311, 46692, 1461, 11, 358, 690, 13, 1442, 358, 617, 311, 4148, 1461, 358, 690, 3238, 3475, 65556, 706, 1457, 1027, 15753, 1203, 311, 3240, 389, 8079, 6693, 439, 92795, 11, 220, 1691, 11, 12580, 10102, 10405, 369, 19755, 4194, 496, 91204, 117899, 57946, 449, 264, 19671, 1603, 72022, 1077, 304, 279, 13272, 449, 264, 5869, 323, 279, 3515, 1877, 4194, 4291, 1077, 52644, 13, 763, 6931, 5590, 9477, 11, 92795, 63417, 311, 279, 4194, 496, 91204, 11, 72022, 323, 7392, 50540, 13, 1283, 1101, 19755, 7577, 435, 57946, 596, 5679, 323, 6267, 704, 364, 40, 2846, 14931, 358, 1550, 420, 6, 304, 10065, 6680, 389, 264, 7147, 13, 763, 5590, 9477, 11, 92795, 320, 1315, 8, 16584, 311, 47305, 2785, 323, 72022, 435, 57946, 320, 2414, 705, 264, 16795, 4435, 9548, 11, 311, 4648, 11, 323, 1243, 3515, 1877, 449, 1077, 52644, 13, 1115, 1306, 435, 57946, 11, 220, 1419, 11, 1047, 7882, 304, 449, 279, 3995, 893, 311, 3240, 264, 2683, 520, 16795, 4435, 13, 578, 1403, 1047, 264, 4948, 70414, 889, 92795, 1101, 19755, 6818, 311, 5622, 11, 323, 369, 902, 568, 12580, 459, 4194, 56605, 291, 4194, 66206, 1126, 6900, 13, 3011, 70414, 8349, 92795, 25349, 78721, 1124, 323, 3782, 520, 1124, 449, 264, 22145, 13, 4740, 279, 10672, 11, 92795, 374, 11846, 311, 617, 4529, 435, 57946, 596, 1841, 323, 6818, 311, 733, 311, 264, 36867, 311, 3780, 264, 22068, 6166, 304, 16388, 430, 568, 1053, 387, 6689, 5710, 22364, 433, 520, 4379, 13, 1283, 1101, 4024, 323, 2751, 264, 86824, 13, 23323, 2019, 279, 3995, 893, 912, 5129, 4934, 311, 3974, 382, 19791, 25], prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

The London super-middleweight will take on Dirrell for the IBF belt vacated by Carl Froch earlier this year. DeGale is bidding to become the first British Olympic gold medalist to win a world title, seven years after the Beijing Games. James DeGale will fight\xa0Andre Dirrell in Boston on May 23 for the IBF\xa0super-middleweight title. The 29-year-old had hoped for home advantage but his promoter Eddie Hearn lost out when the fight went to purse bids earlier this month. DeGale will, however, earn a minimum of $1.5million (£1m) from the bout. DeGale will fight for the IBF belt which was vacated by Carl Froch. Andre Dirrell has lost one professional fight in his career - to Carl Froch back in 2009. 'Andre Dirrell is a very, very good opponent,'he told Sky Sports News. 'He's tall, a tricky southpaw and he's a bit like me. People say our styles will clash but I think we'll gell. We're both ambitious, there's a lot on the line.' Dirrell is no stranger to British fans after losing a split decision to Froch in Nottingham in 2009, his only professional defeat to date. The 31-year-old has fought just six times since, but enjoyed three routine victories last year.\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=128, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=False, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: [128000, 9370, 5730, 553, 279, 2768, 3754, 4652, 304, 220, 4386, 11460, 13, 5321, 2612, 279, 12399, 1193, 11, 2085, 904, 1023, 1495, 382, 17064, 512, 29184, 1611, 38, 1604, 2011, 5944, 311, 10406, 369, 813, 1317, 90350, 1917, 2316, 8815, 994, 568, 12580, 27525, 31194, 16684, 389, 3297, 220, 1419, 13, 578, 7295, 2307, 51167, 4870, 690, 1935, 389, 31194, 16684, 369, 279, 12373, 37, 19671, 9467, 660, 555, 22770, 24304, 331, 6931, 420, 1060, 13, 1611, 38, 1604, 374, 49500, 311, 3719, 279, 1176, 8013, 25944, 6761, 37712, 380, 311, 3243, 264, 1917, 2316, 11, 8254, 1667, 1306, 279, 27647, 11871, 13, 7957, 1611, 38, 1604, 690, 4465, 4194, 84281, 31194, 16684, 304, 10406, 389, 3297, 220, 1419, 369, 279, 12373, 37, 4194, 9712, 51167, 4870, 2316, 13, 578, 220, 1682, 4771, 6418, 1047, 26253, 369, 2162, 9610, 719, 813, 66642, 41780, 473, 10326, 5675, 704, 994, 279, 4465, 4024, 311, 53101, 44599, 6931, 420, 2305, 13, 1611, 38, 1604, 690, 11, 4869, 11, 7380, 264, 8187, 315, 400, 16, 13, 20, 59413, 54915, 16, 76, 8, 505, 279, 25646, 13, 1611, 38, 1604, 690, 4465, 369, 279, 12373, 37, 19671, 902, 574, 9467, 660, 555, 22770, 24304, 331, 13, 27525, 31194, 16684, 706, 5675, 832, 6721, 4465, 304, 813, 7076, 482, 311, 22770, 24304, 331, 1203, 304, 220, 1049, 24, 13, 364, 84281, 31194, 16684, 374, 264, 1633, 11, 1633, 1695, 15046, 2965, 383, 3309, 15064, 13482, 5513, 13, 364, 1548, 596, 16615, 11, 264, 34553, 10007, 79, 675, 323, 568, 596, 264, 2766, 1093, 757, 13, 9029, 2019, 1057, 9404, 690, 41003, 719, 358, 1781, 584, 3358, 342, 616, 13, 1226, 2351, 2225, 32855, 11, 1070, 596, 264, 2763, 389, 279, 1584, 3238, 31194, 16684, 374, 912, 35058, 311, 8013, 7359, 1306, 13490, 264, 6859, 5597, 311, 24304, 331, 304, 67659, 304, 220, 1049, 24, 11, 813, 1193, 6721, 18506, 311, 2457, 13, 578, 220, 2148, 4771, 6418, 706, 21095, 1120, 4848, 3115, 2533, 11, 719, 14333, 2380, 14348, 46146, 1566, 1060, 382, 19791, 25], prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

The widower would often find unusually shaped rocks as he delivered mail in France, and ended up pushing a wheelbarrow each day on his 18-mile route to collect stones of beauty. What started as a small hobby, soon became a life project in 1879, resulting in one of the most magnificent amateur architectural structures to date;\xa0Le Palais idéal. Scroll down for video. A postman in France spent 33 years constructing a lavish grotto, complete with pillars, towers and buttresses. Le Palais idéal features mythical creatures, inspired from the postcards and magazines he had to deliver on his postal route in France. From a glance you would be mistaken for thinking this was an Angkor palace, as the grotto has  influences from Hinduism. Ferdinand Cheval left school at age 13 to become a baker's apprentice, but ended up delivering mail in the Hauterives area. The idea for the elaborate cathedral came when he tripped over an unusually shaped rock in his 30s. He later wrote in his journal: 'I wanted to know the cause. In a dream I had built a palace, a castle or caves. I told no one about it for fear of being ridiculed and I felt ridiculous myself. 'I said to myself: since Nature is willing to do the sculpture, I will do the masonry and the architecture.' Cheval would haul his findings to a site in Hauterives every day after work, and thus began the ambitious 33 year project, completed with no outside help. The dedicated builder would often have to work well into the night, by the light of an oil lamp, but that didn't deter him from his mission. Cheval would construct the palace at night, after work, by the light of oil lamps.\xa0In 1969, André Malraux, the Minister of Culture, declared the Palais a cultural landmark and had it officially protected. The website for the palace states\xa0it was built with no architectural rules and is regarded as a great example of outsider artwork. Due to the long hours of the project, the widower left his son in the care of godparents, in order to be able to focus his energies on his work. The outer walls, measuring 24 metres in length, and 10 metres high, took 22 years to complete, with Cheval binding the stones together with lime, mortar and cement. Le Palais idéal is as intricate as it is vast, and includes sculptures of exotic animals and mythical creatures, which were inspired by the postcards he delivered, and with influences from\xa0Christianity and Hinduism. The structure is beloved by visitors today, 100 years after it was constructed, and was even featured on the french stamp in 1986. When Cheval died, he requested that he could be buried at the palace. Sadly it was not permitted and the talented constructor ended up building his own mausoleum for himself in the cemetery where he was buried after his death in 1924, a year after finishing the palace. The structure is beloved by visitors today, 100 years after it was constructed, and was even featured on the french stamp in 1986. Perhaps most poignant explanation for the architectural wonder is the inscription carved into the palace by Cheval: 'The dream of one man.'\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=128, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=False, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: [128000, 9370, 5730, 553, 279, 2768, 3754, 4652, 304, 220, 4386, 11460, 13, 5321, 2612, 279, 12399, 1193, 11, 2085, 904, 1023, 1495, 382, 17064, 512, 49, 638, 5828, 956, 5918, 304, 1938, 11, 323, 433, 7995, 5828, 956, 369, 19624, 1772, 1543, 93607, 8602, 838, 11, 889, 12514, 220, 1644, 1667, 315, 813, 2324, 50453, 459, 15400, 45016, 44439, 11, 4686, 449, 64982, 11, 31056, 44357, 323, 342, 4744, 998, 288, 13, 578, 9923, 1223, 1053, 3629, 1505, 57899, 27367, 23902, 439, 568, 12886, 8232, 304, 9822, 11, 323, 9670, 709, 17919, 264, 13587, 2308, 654, 1855, 1938, 389, 813, 220, 972, 43276, 6149, 311, 6667, 27302, 315, 13444, 13, 3639, 3940, 439, 264, 2678, 32628, 11, 5246, 6244, 264, 2324, 2447, 304, 220, 9674, 24, 11, 13239, 304, 832, 315, 279, 1455, 41792, 19077, 43563, 14726, 311, 2457, 26, 4194, 2356, 11165, 2852, 887, 63497, 13, 23198, 1523, 369, 2835, 13, 362, 1772, 1543, 304, 9822, 7543, 220, 1644, 1667, 50453, 264, 80234, 342, 4744, 998, 11, 4686, 449, 64982, 11, 40825, 323, 31056, 44357, 13, 2009, 11165, 2852, 887, 63497, 4519, 84219, 20566, 11, 14948, 505, 279, 1772, 26076, 323, 32947, 568, 1047, 311, 6493, 389, 813, 40854, 6149, 304, 9822, 13, 5659, 264, 34522, 499, 1053, 387, 37104, 369, 7422, 420, 574, 459, 7568, 41817, 44439, 11, 439, 279, 342, 4744, 998, 706, 220, 34453, 505, 36142, 2191, 13, 93607, 8602, 838, 2163, 2978, 520, 4325, 220, 1032, 311, 3719, 264, 76928, 596, 83299, 11, 719, 9670, 709, 24944, 8232, 304, 279, 84334, 261, 1924, 3158, 13, 578, 4623, 369, 279, 37067, 80250, 3782, 994, 568, 2463, 7069, 927, 459, 57899, 27367, 7091, 304, 813, 220, 966, 82, 13, 1283, 3010, 6267, 304, 813, 8486, 25, 364, 40, 4934, 311, 1440, 279, 5353, 13, 763, 264, 8063, 358, 1047, 5918, 264, 44439, 11, 264, 33684, 477, 66664, 13, 358, 3309, 912, 832, 922, 433, 369, 8850, 315, 1694, 20561, 8615, 323, 358, 6612, 27873, 7182, 13, 364, 40, 1071, 311, 7182, 25, 2533, 22037, 374, 10032, 311, 656, 279, 51067, 11, 358, 690, 656, 279, 296, 51893, 323, 279, 18112, 3238, 8602, 838, 1053, 38968, 813, 14955, 311, 264, 2816, 304, 84334, 261, 1924, 1475, 1938, 1306, 990, 11, 323, 8617, 6137, 279, 32855, 220, 1644, 1060, 2447, 11, 8308, 449, 912, 4994, 1520, 13, 578, 12514, 7514, 1053, 3629, 617, 311, 990, 1664, 1139, 279, 3814, 11, 555, 279, 3177, 315, 459, 5707, 29062, 11, 719, 430, 3287, 956, 4130, 1461, 505, 813, 9131, 13, 8602, 838, 1053, 9429, 279, 44439, 520, 3814, 11, 1306, 990, 11, 555, 279, 3177, 315, 5707, 50552, 13, 4194, 644, 220, 5162, 24, 11, 85900, 8560, 969, 2249, 11, 279, 9675, 315, 21023, 11, 14610, 279, 11165, 2852, 264, 13042, 38350, 323, 1047, 433, 19073, 2682, 13, 578, 3997, 369, 279, 44439, 5415, 4194, 275, 574, 5918, 449, 912, 43563, 5718, 323, 374, 27458, 439, 264, 2294, 3187, 315, 75683, 29409, 13, 24586, 311, 279, 1317, 4207, 315, 279, 2447, 11, 279, 9923, 1223, 2163, 813, 4538, 304, 279, 2512, 315, 10087, 26534, 11, 304, 2015, 311, 387, 3025, 311, 5357, 813, 49969, 389, 813, 990, 13, 578, 16335, 14620, 11, 30090, 220, 1187, 37356, 304, 3160, 11, 323, 220, 605, 37356, 1579, 11, 3952, 220, 1313, 1667, 311, 4686, 11, 449, 8602, 838, 11212, 279, 27302, 3871, 449, 42819, 11, 58560, 323, 24532, 13, 2009, 11165, 2852, 887, 63497, 374, 439, 57216, 439, 433, 374, 13057, 11, 323, 5764, 75973, 315, 39418, 10099, 323, 84219, 20566, 11, 902, 1051, 14948, 555, 279, 1772, 26076, 568, 12886, 11, 323, 449, 34453, 505, 4194, 42042, 488, 323, 36142, 2191, 13, 578, 6070, 374, 28530, 555, 15613, 3432, 11, 220, 1041, 1667, 1306, 433, 574, 20968, 11, 323, 574, 1524, 15109, 389, 279, 42293, 21899, 304, 220, 3753, 21, 13, 3277, 8602, 838, 8636, 11, 568, 11472, 430, 568, 1436, 387, 28016, 520, 279, 44439, 13, 57243, 433, 574, 539, 15480, 323, 279, 23944, 4797, 9670, 709, 4857, 813, 1866, 7643, 355, 1286, 372, 369, 5678, 304, 279, 59404, 1405, 568, 574, 28016, 1306, 813, 4648, 304, 220, 5926, 19, 11, 264, 1060, 1306, 25270, 279, 44439, 13, 578, 6070, 374, 28530, 555, 15613, 3432, 11, 220, 1041, 1667, 1306, 433, 574, 20968, 11, 323, 574, 1524, 15109, 389, 279, 42293, 21899, 304, 220, 3753, 21, 13, 19292, 1455, 93447, 16540, 369, 279, 43563, 5895, 374, 279, 51670, 49267, 1139, 279, 44439, 555, 8602, 838, 25, 364, 791, 8063, 315, 832, 893, 22438, 19791, 25], prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

Mr Boselli revealed he works out two to three times a day and said his best feature is his 'perseverance and inconsistency'. In an interview with F Tape he said he would be concentrating on 'engineering, teaching maths and personal training' if he was not modelling. He posted a picture of his washboard abs on his Instagram, saying: 'Lying in bed.. My point of view' Mr Boselli revealed he works out two to three times a day and said his best feature is his 'perseverance and inconsistency' He also revealed that\xa0Arnold Schwarzenegger, Oscar Wilde and The Rolling Stones were among his idols. Hundreds of fans have taken to social media to say they would have concentrated slightly harder in lessons if Mr Boselli had been their teacher. Rachel Ruane said: 'Would trade my maths teacher for him in a heartbeat oh my god #PietroBoselli #teachmealgebraanyday.' Cassy Chavez said: 'I would never miss a class too!' Aly Dos Equis said: 'Good thing this guy wasn't my math teacher I'd have a hard time paying attention.' Pieter Botha \u200fsaid: 'No fair! I never had a math teacher like you? I would've passed.'

A mechanic who lived a calm, quiet life with his elderly parents was all the time living a secret double life as a sex attacker. Clive Howard, 56, of Suffolk, has admitted carrying out a string of rapes and kidnaps of women during a 28 year period. The serial rapist confessed to the crimes after he was caught after raping a woman at a car park in Norwich when his number plate was recorded on CCTV. But police fear he may have carried out even more attacks across three different counties and have appealed for any victims to come forward. Detective Sergeant Chris Burgess, of Norfolk Police rape investigation unit said:\xa0'Cases like this don't come up very often - we're talking about a serial rapist. 'We want to give people the chance to come forward.' Howard, who lived a double life with his parents, had initially denied the rape in Norwich but changed his plea on the day of his trial. At a hearing at Norwich Crown Court he admitted seven counts of rape, three charges of attempted kidnap and one count of attempted rape, between 1986 and 2014. Howard, of Battisford, near Stowmarket, Suffolk, was caught by police after he attacked a woman in St Helens Wharf car park, Norwich, on May 30 2014. The victim, in her 20s, was walking home after a night out when she was given a lift by Howard, who then raped her. She tried to take a picture of the car's registration number but Howard grabbed her phone and hurled it into a bush before he sped off. \xa0The woman found it before dialling 999. Police were able to\xa0get part of the car's number plate from\xa0CCTV - and that led them straight to Howard, the registered owner. He was arrested and charged a few days later. Det Sgt Burgess said Howard had done 'two to three loops' around the city 'before he managed to pick his victim'. After he was charged Howard's DNA was put into the national police database which raised an\xa0unsolved case in Cambridgeshire in 2013. Howard was caught after part of his Volvo number plate was captured on CCTV after he raped a woman. Howard's number plate was recorded after he parked at St Helens Wharf in Norwich and raped the woman. Detectives found'striking similarities' to the Norwich assault. Howard's DNA matched a profile obtained during an investigation into the attempted kidnap of a woman in her 20s on May 5, 2013 in\xa0Cambridge park Christ's Pieces.\xa0The woman managed to fend off Howard, scratching him in the process, and DNA was later retrieved from underneath her fingernail. He was linked to three other attempted kidnappings in Cambridge, one of which happened just 30 minutes before he struck in Christ's Pieces.\xa0Howard also tried to abduct two women in the city on February 15, 2014, during the night. Det Sgt Burgess said: 'All were in the early hours of the morning. 'Each of the women were approached by a man who had got out of a car and attempted to get them into it.' He lived a double life with his parents as a mechanic but carried out a string of rapes and attempted kidnaps. He added: 'I'm concerned there are other victims out there either in Norfolk, Suffolk or Cambridge and would urge other women to come forward. 'It's very rare.' As well as the rape in Norwich, Howard also admitted six counts of rape against a woman between November 1986 and March 1993. Howard, who is understood to have had an 82-year-old girlfriend, was remanded in custody and will be sentenced at the court on April 20. Judge Stephen Holt told him: 'You've pleaded guilty and the one thing that can be said is your victim has been spared the ordeal of giving evidence. 'I'm sure you will understand I need to have a full pre-sentence report and the whole issue of whether you need to be sentenced as a dangerous offender will be made.' Det Sgt Burgess said: 'Reliving an experience such as this is never easy for a victim of sexual assault. 'I recognise the bravery shown by all victims in this case who would have been prepared to give evidence, had the case gone to trial. 'Howard's guilty plea demonstrates the strong case police had against him and I believe women are safer with this dangerous man off the streets,' he said. 'A striking similarity between the cases is that Howard would prey on women walking alone at night. 'I hope his guilty plea goes some way to helping his victims move forward from this terrible experience.' Howard was a respectable garage mechanic who didn't have a criminal record and lived an extraordinary double life with his elderly parents in Battisford.\xa0He also had his own house in nearby Stowmarket. He is thought to have had an 82-year-old girlfriend but was 'actively seeking sexual partners' on internet dating sites.\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0,

Please output the summary only, without any other text.\n\nArticle:\nSnow over the weekend shattered records to make this winter Boston's snowiest ever - but Mother Nature might not be done yet. The city awoke Monday yet again to its accustomed blanket of white - but this time it had a special significance, as the latest 2.9 inches pushed the city into unprecedented territory of 108.6 inches in one season. But, though temperatures in Massachusetts are regularly above freezing now, there could still be new flurries to take the record even higher before spring sets in. Snowy: In this  photo, a car remains buried in snow February 23, 2015 along a residential street in South Boston. Boston's miserable winter is now also its snowiest season going back to 1872. Relentless: People use umbrellas to protect themselves from falling snow as they cross a street in Boston's North End neighborhood, Sunday, March 15, 2015. According to the Weather Channel, Friday night could bring an extra fraction of an inch. Meanwhile predictions from\xa0AccuWeather\xa0note the chance of snow around 7am Wednesday, and a vaguer prediction of a snow/slush downfall on Saturday night. The previous record was 107.9 inches, which was set in the winter of 1995-96. The records cover more than a century, going back to 1872. Boston's official total is measured at Logan airport, by an anonymous figure who heads outside with a ruler, takes an average of four measurements and submits his totals to the National Weather Service. Celebration: The Boston branch of the National Weather Service posted this celebratory image 'congratulating' the city on months of unrelenting snow. The final 2.9 inches came in a snowstorm that was relatively tame after a record-setting monthly snowfall of 64.9 inches in February. The worst previous single month was January 2005 when 43.3 inches fell. This official winter snowfall, measured from December through February this year, was 99.4 inches. That was the snowiest for the winter period, beating 91.5 inches in 1993-94. The season snowfall record is measured from July 1 through June 30, and takes in autumn and spring. Forecasters note snow can still mount up this year. March 1993 had 38.9 inches, and March 1916 had 33. Misery: Steven Watson, a dog trainer and walker, navigates a six-strong pack of dogs over a snow-cleared path at the Boston Common. At the height of the relentless snow storms, residents of Boston were left wondering when the weather would calm down. Last month,  Boston's transport system ground to a halt as authorities struggled to cope with the bad weather. At one point, Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) public transport was not running at all and had no subways or buses. Meanwhile, flights to and from Boston's Logan Airport were canceled. It's been a brutal winter for many people across the East Coast of the United States with non-stop snow storms. However, Boston's residents have begun to recover from the plummeting temperatures which fell to around zero. Matt Doody, a meteorologist at the weather service told\xa0The Boston Globe\xa0the record-breaking figures were 'pretty impressive.' Foot upon foot of unrelenting snow did little to brighten the spirits of Boston's residents - but it did have one silver lining. In the wake of blizzard season, a costumed joker who dubbed himself the Boston Yeti started cropping up around the blanketed city. And now the figure, whose @BostonYeti2015\xa0Twitter account has amassed 8,500 followers, has received his just reward. King of winter: The so-called Boston Yeti, who was pictured around the city amidst relentless snowstorms, was jokingly made mayor on St Patrick's day. In the midst of the city's St Patrick's day parade on Sunday, mayor Marty Walsh invited the masked figure to pose in front of a City of Boston backdrop and declared him 'interim mayor'. However, Walsh did feel compelled to step in moments after the prank and clarify 'I love Boston and am here to stay'. Only kidding: Boston's actual mayor Marty Walsh, left, soon stepped in to clarify that he wasn't being replaced by a mythical figure.

Judith Tebbutt was taken from her luxury Kenyan lodge in 2011 and held hostage for six months by armed pirates who also killed her husband. Ali Babitu Kololo was found guilty of robbery with violence in August 2013. He is the only person to be convicted so far. But due to data laws judges could soon compel Scotland Yard to disclose key documents that could lead to his conviction being overturned. Ali Babitu Kololo (left) was sentenced to death after he confessed to helping kidnap British tourist Judith Tebbutt (right). He is now challenging Scotland Yard over their use of his information. The decision will be made amid allegations British authorities 'acted unlawfully'. Under the Overseas Justice and Security Act the UK, which helped the public prosecution in the case, is required to seek assurance that the death penalty will not be sought. The 35-year-old also claims he was tortured by local police and forced to confess, which similarly goes against UK laws. The father-of-two now wants to know what information Scotland Yard held on him, which Kenyan authorities it shared the information with and what it plans on doing with it in the future. Scotland Yard has so far refused to allow Kololo to see any of the information, which he believes will help him in his appeal. Human rights charity Reprieve, which is supporting Kololo, said: 'The Metropolitan Police helped secure the conviction of a man who was tortured in a mandatory death penalty case, in clear violation of UK policy. Kololo (centre) was found guilty of robbery with violence in 2013 - but the 35-year-old claims he was tortured by local police and forced to confess. The father-of-two, pictured in a Kenyan court,\xa0is hoping the personal information they hold on him will help with his appeal. Human rights charity Reprieve said he did not have a fair trial. 'Mr Kololo has a right to know what information the Met has on him and how they plan to use it. 'He has already suffered grave injustices thanks in large part to the actions of the Met. 'Scotland Yard must comply with British law and come clean about the information they hold on Mr Kololo.' Kololo was arrested hours after the attack on Ms Tebbutt and her husband in September 2011. Kenyan police believed that he deliberately led five Somali gunmen to the property although he said he was ordered at gunpoint to show the way to the hotel. Ms Tebbutt (second from left) was dramatically released after a ransom payment, reportedly around £600,000, ended her six-month ordeal. But Ms Tebbutt told the court that her captors had told her the sixth gang member had been arrested. The 60-year-old tourist, from Bishop's Stortford, was dramatically released after a ransom payment, reportedly around £600,000, ended her six-month ordeal. She said at the time of her release: 'I am of course hugely relieved to at last be free, and overjoyed to be reunited with my son Ollie. 'This however is a time when my joy at being safe again is overwhelmed by my immense grief, shared by Ollie and the wider family, following David's passing in September last year.' Kenyan police believed that Kololo deliberately led five Somali gunmen to the property (above) - but he said he was ordered at gunpoint to show the way to the hotel. Reprieve argued that Kololo, who had no lawyer or interpreter, did not receive a fair trial. They also said he was also forced to cross-examine witnesses on his own. London law firm Leigh Day is representing Kololo. It said: 'The Metropolitan Police has refused to provide our client with access to the data it holds about him, which may well contain material that shows his conviction is not safe and that his death sentence should be overturned.' Metropolitan Police said they do not comment on ongoing cases. The High Court is expected to rule in the case tomorrow.\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0,

After a disastrous World Cup, the Three Lions have fallen despite winning all four of their Euro 2016 qualifiers against Switzerland, San Marino, Estonia and Slovenia as well as international friendlies against Scotland and Norway. However, with rankings based on results over the last four years, England are below  Costa Rica (13) who held them to\xa0a goalless draw in Brazil before winning their World Cup Group D. England have fallen behind the likes of Romania and Czech Republic in the latest FIFA rankings. Three Lions manager Roy Hodgson has seen his side fallen despite being unbeaten since the World Cup. A team’s total number of points over a four-year period is determined by adding:. The average number of points gained from matches during the past 12 months. And, the average number of points gained from matches older than 12 months (depreciates yearly). Meanwhile, 2010 World Cup winners and reigning European champions Spain have fallen out of the top 10 in FIFA's rankings for the first time since 2007. World Cup winners Germany is still No 1 ahead of Argentina, Colombia, Belgium and the Netherlands. The only change in the top 10 is that Italy rise two places up to 10th, while Spain drop one spot to 11th. None of the elite teams played in the last month, but games played earlier in the four-year cycle of results lost ranking value. Reigning European champions Spain have fallen out of the top 10 for the first time since 2007. Romania rise two places at No 14 and could be seeded in July when European qualifying groups for the 2018 World Cup are drawn. Costa Rica remain No 13 to lead CONCACAF nations. The United States falls one to No 32. Algeria at No 18 lead the African nations. Iran are Asia's best at No 42. World Cup winners Germany unsurprisingly remain at the top of this month's FIFA world rankings. 1.

But while many, in the UK especially, had to contend with clouds, plenty of images captured the event – and an odd black spot on the sun. While it might have looked like a speck of dust at first, this was actually a sunspot on the solar surface, caused by a concentration of magnetic fields. Scroll down for video. People in the UK were treated to a partial solar eclipse this morning. But several observers spotted some strange black dots on the sun (shown). These were sunspots, caused by concentrations of magnetic fields. They are sometimes associated with eruptions such as solar flares. Sunspots are fairly common, with the number on the surface correlating with how active the sun is. They occur when a concentration of magnetic fields causes the surface temperature to reduce, making a specific section stand out from the surroundings. They range hugely in size, from just 10 miles (16km) to 100,000 miles (160,000km) - big enough to be seen from Earth without a telescope, and more than ten times the size of our planet. Sunspots are regions where powerful magnetic fields emanate from the sun. These magnetic fields can get wound up so tightly that they rise up from inside the Sun, and the sunspots mark the points where this happens. They are much colder than the rest of the sun's surface and usually last a few days before disappearing. They have a temperature of anywhere from 2,700 to 4,200°C (4,890 to 7,590°F), compared to 5,500°C (9,930°F) for the surrounding solar material, which is why they are so visible. Sunspots are also sometimes the source of eruptions on the sun, namely solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs), all of which are linked to magnetic fields. The sun goes through a periodic change in activity known as a solar cycle, which has an average duration of 11 years, which also changes the frequency of sunspots. Sunspots should not be confused with coronal holes, regions of the corona - an aura of plasma around the sun - where the magnetic field reaches out into space rather than looping back down onto the surface. Sunspots (previous Nasa image shown) are fairly common, with the number on the surface correlating with how active the sun is. They occur when a concentration of magnetic fields causes the surface temperature to reduce, making a specific section stand out from the surroundings. Some observers took to Twitter to express their views on the sunspots, which were spotted in live footage showing the moon passing across the face of the sun. Others bemoaned the cloud coverage in the UK, which meant that many observers were unable to actually see the event at all. There were more than 10,000 mentions of the eclipse per minute on Twitter, according to social media monitoring company Brandwatch. The sun goes through a periodic change in activity known as a solar cycle, which has an average duration of 11 years, which also changes the frequency of sunspots. In this Nasa image, multiple sunspots can be seen across the solar surface. This morning, millions across Britain stopped to watch the country's first solar eclipse this century, which plunged parts of the UK in to brief darkness. Astronomer Gemma Lavender from All About Space magazine explains:. 'When a solar eclipse occurs, what you’re witnessing is Earth, moon and the sun aligning. 'Eclipses can only really happen at a new moon. With this in mind, it’s quite easy to think that we should get an eclipse every month but because the moon’s orbit around  Earth is tilted by around five degrees to that of our planet’s, our natural satellite’s shadow usually misses the Earth’s surface by passing above or below it. 'It’s only really at least twice a year that the geometry lines up just right to make an eclipse for observers in a particular part of the world. 'The sun is roughly 400 times bigger than the moon but it is also around 400 times further away from us. As a result, the sun and the moon have the same size in the sky to make a partial or total eclipse. 'There are two types of eclipse - a partial and a total. During a partial solar eclipse, only some of the sun’s surface gets blocked out by our lunar companion. 'With a total eclipse, all of the Sun’s surface gets covered by the moon, creating a shadow that is projected onto  Earth. Day turns into darkness for a few minutes for observers in this shadow. 'However, when the moon passes in front of the sun, we don’t always get a total eclipse. 'Instead, we get an annular eclipse, also known as a ‘ring of fire’ - that’s when the Moon is at a further distance from the Earth in its orbit and therefore appears smaller, unable to cover the Sun’s disc entirely. 'At a distance of around 220,000 miles (357,000 kilometres) on 20 March though, the sun’s disc was sufficiently covered.' Britain's skies began to darken at around 8.24am this morning as the moon started to move between us and the sun, with the eclipse peaking at around 9.30am across the country. The sun's light was almost totally concealed, casting a huge shadow of the moon across the nation turning day briefly to night, but watchers could not look directly at the sun because they risked damaging their eyes. In the Hebrides the sun was practically invisible as the Isle of Lewis experienced a 98 per cent eclipse, while the Faroe Islands saw a total eclipse. But cloud coverage meant that millions across Britain were unable to see anything at all of the eclipse, the like of which will not be seen again for several more decades. The last solar eclipse of such significance occurred on August 11 1999, and was 'total' - with 100 per cent of the sun covered when seen from Cornwall. Another 'deep' partial eclipse visible in the UK will not occur until August 12 2026, and the next total eclipse not until September 2090. Today's eclipse produced a 100-mile-wide 'totality' shadow path that crossed the North Atlantic and covers only two land masses, the Faroe Islands between Scotland and Iceland and the Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard. Away from this path the sun was partly obscured. A partial eclipse was visible across a large part of the northern hemisphere, including the whole of Europe, Greenland, Newfoundland, northern Africa and western Asia. More than 100 people flocked to the 5,000-year-old Callanish Stones on the Isle of Lewis to witness the solar eclipse. And they were rewarded most of the time by a break in the clouds - almost to the point of near totality. Lewis had been billed as the prime place in Britain to see the solar phenomenon. Caroline Pritchard, 58, and her partner Laurence McCallum, 50, travelled 905 miles in a 21 hour car and ferry journey - together with their three dogs - to see the event. This morning, millions across Britain stopped to watch the country's first solar eclipse this century, which plunged parts of the UK in to brief darkness. 'This is the end of the age of Aquarius and we wanted to get here to see the eclipse,' said Mr McCallum, who works in a fine food business. 'I took the week off work unpaid and it has been worth it. It was fantastic. We arrived on Tuesday and unfortunately missed the other great astronomical event here this week - the Northern Lights. But the eclipse more than made up for it.' Ms Pritchard agreed: 'I am a spiritual person and I was drawn here to see the eclipse. I believe in powers greater than ourselves.' Islander Linda Vaughan, 62, from Crossbost, rang a Tibetan bowl to herald the eclipse as it created dusk - with temperatures noticeably plunging with the sun's infra red blocked out. 'The sound resonates with the stones. This is a spiritual and sacred place.. It is about creating the right harmony,' she said. The sun's light was almost totally concealed, casting a huge shadow of the moon across the nation turning day briefly to night, but watchers could not look directly at the sun because they risked damaging their eyes. Instead, solar eclipse glasses (shown) helped people observe the event. Four intrepid shadow seekers even boarded a special boat trip with Kilda Cruises from Leverburgh on the Isle of Harris at 5am to witness the eclipse at remote St Kilda. The archipelago, 41 miles (66km) west of the main Outer Hebrides, was forecast to be cloud free at the time of the event. Donny Mackay, president of the Stornoway Astronomical Society, said it received over 500 inquiries by email - as well as 100 phone calls - from all over the UK as well as far away as Germany. 'I was a bit worried when I saw the cloud early this morning but it turned out as good as we could have hoped for. It was really memorable,' he said.\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0,

Please output the summary only, without any other text.\n\nArticle:\nOn their first date, Tony Abbott wouldn't stop talking about the split between the ALP (Australian Labor Party) and the DLP (Democratic Labor Party) in the mid-1950s. Later on in their courtship, he would take her trekking down the Kokoda Trail - with a mate in tow - and would lavish her with bouquets of roses. Margie Abbott, Australia's so-called 'First Lady', has opened about how she was wooed by the future PM in an interview published in the latest issue of\xa0The Australian Women's Weekly. Margie Abbott (pictured at November's G20 summit, holding a koala bear) has begun taking up a more prominent role alongside her husband. Mrs Abbott (with husband Tony) told Women's Weekly how Mr Abbott wooed her in the late 1980s - with champagne, roses, and discussions about politics. Margie Abbott conducted an exclusive interview with the latest edition of The Australian Women's Weekly. The pair first met on a blind date at a Sydney tavern around 1987 - and six months later he would propose to her in an inner-Sydney restaurant, the pair celebrating with French champagne. 'I think we'd both pretty quickly made the decision that we'd met somebody we wanted to spend the rest of our lives with,' Mrs Abbott told the Weekly. The interview was a rare public moment of candour for Mrs Abbott, who has mostly managed to keep out of the limelight throughout her husband's federal political career of more than two decades. However, she has become noticeably more prominent in Mr Abbott's public appearances since he faced the humiliating prospect of a leadership spill motion in mid-February. In the Weekly interview, the Kiwi-born Mrs Abbott also faced questions about current political issues. She declined to answer questions about her thoughts on the Prime Minister dumping his much-touted paid parental leave scheme. Mrs Abbott, who works with a number of charities, has fulfilled her role as 'First Lady' at official functions. Here she is on Wednesday with her husband, greeting Vietnam's Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung and Madame Tran Thanh Kiem. Perks of office: Mrs Abbott is pictured here with the family dog Maisie during a visit to the veterinary clinic earlier this year. Peta Credlin (pictured), Tony Abbott's chief of staff, has been the target of several Liberal party members because of her controversial management style. Mr Abbott has promised a 'better deal' for parents with child care in his next Budget (which he said this week would be'much more boring' than last year's). Asked about Peta Credlin - the leader's chief of staff who was a central issue among several Liberal MPs in the recent Liberal Party turmoil - Mrs Abbott told the Weekly she juggled a difficult job. Ms Credlin has come under sustained public attack since late last year. The ABC's Four Corners program this week published a text message sent by Liberal Party treasurer Phil Higginson which described her as 'the horsewoman of the apocalypse' and sought her removal. 'At the end of the day, Peta works incredibly hard and it's a tough job,' Mrs Abbott said.

The youngster was sitting in a silver Toyota which was driving on an A-road in Buckinghamshire when it collided with a blue DAF lorry. Paramedics and an air ambulance crew raced to the scene but the youngster was declared dead at the scene. The seven-year-old boy died following the collision on the Stoke Hammond by-pass in Buckinghamshire. Three people were taken to the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford with serious injuries and the road was closed for several hours while investigators gathered evidence. A Thames Valley Police spokesman said: 'At 2.17pm yesterday on the A4146 Stoke Hammond bypass near the junction with the B4032 Leighton Road a silver Toyota RAV 4 was involved in a collision with a blue DAF lorry. The collision occurred on the south bound dual carriageway. 'Sadly a 7-year-old boy, who was a passenger in the car, died at the scene.' A fire service spokesman said that seven appliances had attended the incident, where firefighters used hydraulic rescue equipment to release three injured women from the vehicles. A man, thought to be the lorry driver, escaped from his vehicle uninjured before fire crews arrived. Police constable Sandra Terry said: 'This is a very sad case where a young boy has lost his life. 'We are in the process of investigating the circumstances which led to these tragic consequences and so would urge anyone who was in the area before this time and saw the incident itself or who had seen either vehicle prior to the collision to please contact us as a matter of urgency.' A 33-year-old man from Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire was arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving and bailed while the investigation continues. Anyone with information on the collision is asked to contact Thames Valley Police on 101.\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=128, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=False, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: [128000, 9370, 5730, 553, 279, 2768, 3754, 4652, 304, 220, 4386, 11460, 13, 5321, 2612, 279, 12399, 1193, 11, 2085, 904, 1023, 1495, 382, 17064, 512, 32, 8254, 4771, 6418, 8334, 574, 7577, 994, 264, 8987, 11822, 7458, 79990, 449, 279, 1841, 568, 574, 31829, 304, 13, 578, 83371, 574, 11961, 304, 264, 15310, 30300, 902, 574, 10043, 389, 459, 362, 66815, 304, 96011, 15255, 994, 433, 79990, 449, 264, 6437, 423, 8440, 326, 8635, 13, 7136, 81811, 323, 459, 3805, 51632, 13941, 72154, 311, 279, 6237, 719, 279, 83371, 574, 14610, 5710, 520, 279, 6237, 13, 578, 8254, 4771, 6418, 8334, 8636, 2768, 279, 19277, 389, 279, 84697, 65443, 555, 48067, 304, 96011, 15255, 13, 14853, 1274, 1051, 4529, 311, 279, 3842, 21254, 80556, 15429, 304, 26275, 449, 6129, 15319, 323, 279, 5754, 574, 8036, 369, 3892, 4207, 1418, 26453, 20802, 6029, 13, 362, 82288, 13345, 10289, 18367, 1071, 25, 364, 1688, 220, 17, 13, 1114, 5298, 13985, 389, 279, 362, 17448, 21, 84697, 65443, 31818, 3221, 279, 49341, 449, 279, 426, 13074, 17, 2009, 88873, 9728, 264, 15310, 30300, 432, 8253, 220, 19, 574, 6532, 304, 264, 19277, 449, 264, 6437, 423, 8440, 326, 8635, 13, 578, 19277, 10222, 389, 279, 10007, 6965, 19091, 1841, 462, 351, 25754, 13, 364, 82800, 264, 220, 22, 4771, 6418, 8334, 11, 889, 574, 264, 24023, 304, 279, 1841, 11, 8636, 520, 279, 6237, 3238, 362, 4027, 2532, 18367, 1071, 430, 8254, 34802, 1047, 18677, 279, 10672, 11, 1405, 53206, 1511, 44175, 17629, 7241, 311, 4984, 2380, 15902, 3278, 505, 279, 11731, 13, 362, 893, 11, 3463, 311, 387, 279, 326, 8635, 5696, 11, 28883, 505, 813, 7458, 71113, 80491, 1603, 4027, 43160, 11721, 13, 10289, 738, 481, 56786, 32618, 1071, 25, 364, 2028, 374, 264, 1633, 12703, 1162, 1405, 264, 3995, 8334, 706, 5675, 813, 2324, 13, 364, 1687, 527, 304, 279, 1920, 315, 24834, 279, 13463, 902, 6197, 311, 1521, 35279, 16296, 323, 779, 1053, 33147, 5606, 889, 574, 304, 279, 3158, 1603, 420, 892, 323, 5602, 279, 10672, 5196, 477, 889, 1047, 3970, 3060, 7458, 4972, 311, 279, 19277, 311, 4587, 3729, 603, 439, 264, 5030, 315, 54917, 3238, 362, 220, 1644, 4771, 6418, 893, 505, 58447, 82603, 11, 96011, 15255, 574, 12800, 389, 38141, 315, 14718, 4648, 555, 11660, 10043, 323, 293, 5805, 1418, 279, 8990, 9731, 13, 33634, 449, 2038, 389, 279, 19277, 374, 4691, 311, 3729, 82288, 13345, 10289, 389, 220, 4645, 382, 19791, 25], prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

But only once in the past decade — Wolves in 2011 — has a team required that total to avoid the drop. Rather, Sportsmail has calculated that the magic number is just 36. Since the turn of the millennium and the establishment of a hierarchy within the top flight — meaning more points are distributed higher up the table — the average of the club finishing third from bottom has been a shade above 35. Struggling duo QPR and Leicester look destined to be heading for the Championship at the end of the season. The current bottom six of the Premier League. That being the case, you can assume that every team upwards of 13th-placed West Brom, on 33 points, will be feeding off the Premier League cash cow come August. Indeed, this weekend saw the bottom six all lose and a points-per-game projection would have all of them finishing the campaign on fewer than 36. But with Leicester and QPR looking increasingly doomed, it is Aston Villa, Hull, Sunderland and Burnley battling to avoid that final spot. Hull City (Odds on being relegated: 5/2) Run-in: Swansea (a), Southampton (a), Liverpool (h), Crystal Palace (a), Arsenal (h), Burnley (h), Tottenham (a), Man Utd (h). Without back-to-back wins over QPR and Aston Villa — inspired by deadline-day arrival Dame N’Doye — Hull would be odds-on for the drop. Just look at their daunting run-in. Remember Norwich City 12 months ago? At this juncture they were 13th and seven points clear of the bottom three. But one point from their final seven matches — which included games against the top four — saw them demoted to the Championship. Steve Bruce’s side finish with a trip to Spurs and the visit of Manchester United and they’ll want to be clear of trouble come the final fortnight. Verdict: They might scramble to about 34 points, and that should be enough, just. Tom Huddlestone (right) will be hoping his side can climb the table during the final batch of league fixtures. Aston Villa (Odds on being relegated: 7/2) Run-in: Man Utd (a), QPR (h), Tottenham (a), Man City (a), Everton (h), West Ham (h), Southampton (a), Burnley (h). If the bounce factor of Tim Sherwood’s arrival falls flat, a deflated Villa could soon be sucked back into serious trouble. Three of the next four are at Old Trafford, White Hart Lane and the Etihad and that, you would think, will throw up zero points. There is also the complicating factor of an FA Cup semi-final. Verdict: Home games against QPR, West Ham and Burnley will decide their fate — if they take six points from these and a draw elsewhere, then they should be fine. Aston Villa striker Christian Benteke has scored six goals for the Midlands outfit so far this season. Sunderland (Odds on being relegated: 5/4) Run-in: Newcastle (h), Crystal Palace (h), Stoke (a), Southampton (h), Everton (a), Leicester (h), Arsenal (a), Chelsea (a). Sunderland were better during Dick Advocaat’s first game in charge at West Ham. However, it still ended in defeat. And given that they see out the campaign with trips to Arsenal and Chelsea, the Dutch boss probably has six games to save the season and preserve his record of never having been relegated. Supposed January saviour Jermain Defoe is misfiring and the Black Cats have scored just once in 11 hours. Verdict: The club should have realised that they were heading for a relegation battle far sooner. Fail to win the Tyne-Wear derby on Easter Sunday and they could be set on a downward spiral which will surely end in the Championship. Sunderland signed Jermain Defoe in hope that he can score the goals to fire the Black Cats to safety. Burnley (Odds on being relegated: 10/11) Run-in: Tottenham (h), Arsenal (h), Everton (a), Leicester (h), West Ham (a), Hull (a), Stoke (h), Aston Villa (a) A recent victory over Manchester City and a draw at Chelsea shows that Sean Dyche’s men show little regard for reputations and that spirit will serve them well as the stakes increase during the closing weeks. Crucially, they play three of their relegation rivals and, to that end, their fate remains in their own hands. Verdict: If Burnley can take eight points from eight games then it could well prove enough and Dyche would be shortlisted for Manager of the Year recognition. Burnley striker Danny Ings is attracting interest from some of the Premier League's big boys.

Please output the summary only, without any other text.\n\nArticle:\nJordan Wills works as a paintball target, with colleagues firing paintballs at him at close range. When student Jordan Wills goes to work he must prepared to pelted by bullets, fired at him at close range and at speeds of almost 40mph. The 19-year-old from London works as a human bullet impact tester, or more simply a paintball target, and every week faces the pellets being fired at his torso to test how hard they are on impact or how large a welt they leave. He beat more than 10,000 other applicants from around the world to land the £16,000 a year job as a tester and fits in being used for target practice around his university studies. 'I guess I have a high pain tolerance - but it's really not as painful as people think,' said the Kingston University Computer Graphics student. 'The hardest part is the anticipation when you know it's coming. 'The most times I'd be shot at during a shift is ten over a course of an hour or two.' And while most people playing paintball will wear some form of protective clothing, Mr Wills does his job in just a t-shirt. He is a fan of the game anyway, and has previously played a lot in his spare time. He works 16 hours a week at different UK Paintball sites across the country on a pro-rata salary of £40,000, which works out at a wage of around £16,000 a year. Mr Wills, who stays in shape as a rower, said despite the welts and the occasional pain he loves his job. He added: 'When people find out what I do they think I'm crazy - but I love my job. 'The initial pain lasts for about five seconds, then it stings for maybe ten seconds - and then it's gone. I don't even remember I've been shot.' The teenager wears protective goggles to cover his eyes - but trusts his well-trained colleagues to steer clear of other vulnerable body parts and stop when he tells them to. The paintballs are fired at Jordan's torso at close range - between 25 and 30 feet by a professional shooter at a speed of almost 40mph. Rather than take the usual approach of fleeing the oncoming paintballs, Mr Wills must stand still while players take aim at him. He reports back on the impact of the paintballs so that manufacturers can ensure new batches are not too hard.  Anything that draws blood, leaves too serious a mark or does not explode on impact is unacceptable. Mr Wills was selected for the role out of 10,000 other applicants because of his knowledge of paintball. The 19-year-old often suffers welts on his body from the impact which take three or four days to disappear. The practice leaves him with welts over his body, but the student said he barely notices. 'Sometimes I take a hot bath after a shift, but mostly I just forget they're even there,' he added. 'At first my girlfriend didn't like it, but now she's cool with it. The marks take about four days to fade. 'I think I got the job because I knew about paintballing already. I worked for three years marshalling games - so I was well aware of what it felt like to be hit. 'I love paintballing and knew about the different types of paints and the ins and outs of the guns. 'People tell me I must be an idiot but it's only people who don't know enough about paintball. When you're in the middle of a game you're running around and having so much fun you hardly notice when you're hit. The teenager does his job wearing just a t-shirt, and endures balls being fired at him at very close range. As part of the role Mr Wills must stand still and resist the urge, as happens in actual games, to run away. 'I work two days a week and my hours are flexible. 'I have great colleagues and get to work outside and have a bit of fun. What's not to like?' Justin Toohig, UK Paintball owner and the student's boss, said: 'Jordan's a great guy. He's up for a laugh, has a fantastic attitude and fits in well with the crew - that's mainly what we were looking for. 'He can take the bullets like a man and doesn't whinge at all. He's athletic and knew about paintball. 'We still can't believe how many applicants we got. Emails were coming in from all over the world - new ones were popping up faster than we could file them. 'Maybe it's a sign of the economy, or simply because people love paintball. Mr Wells insists he doesn't really feel pain from the impact of paintballs being fired at him at close range. Mr Wills said he does not mind being hit or the resulting welts and thinks he has a high threshold for pain. 'In the end we interviewed 18 guys and Jordan got the job. 'We're very careful and would never put Jordan at risk. 'Safety is extremely important to us - that's why we needed a tester in the first place. What Jordan is doing is the extreme. It's done in a controlled environment and we're testing for worst-case scenario. 'We'd never recommend for anyone to emulate it on the playing field or at home.' When the job was advertised last year Mr Toohig was quoted as saying: 'We want to hear from people with a high pain threshold and those to whom fear is a foreign concept.'\n\nSummary:", params:

Children offered a sip of their parents’ wine at parties and social occasions are more likely to start drinking by their mid-teens, researchers warn. A study has found that those who had sipped alcohol by the age of 11 were five times more likely to have had a full drink within a couple of years, and four times more likely to have binged or been drunk than peers who had not tasted alcohol at an early age. The study was carried out in the US where, say researchers, some parents try to lessen the taboo appeal of drinking by following the ‘European model’ of introducing young children to alcohol under supervision at home. Lead researcher Kristina Jackson, of Brown University in Rhode Island, said: ‘Our study provides evidence to the contrary.’ Previous research suggests parental attitudes are one of the most important factors involved in when teens start drinking. A survey of UK schoolchildren found witnessing drinking at home and seeing their parents get drunk raises the risk of children having an alcoholic drink by the age of 13. In the American study, 561 Rhode Island middle-school students were surveyed periodically over three years. At the beginning of sixth grade – around the age of 11 – almost 30 per cent of pupils said they had sipped alcohol. In most cases, their parents provided it – often at a party or other special occasion. By the time the students reached the ages of 14 and 15, one in four early ‘sippers’ said they had had a full alcoholic drink, compared with 6 per cent of those who had not. Almost one in ten of early sippers had got drunk or binged – compared with just under 2 per cent of ‘non-sippers’, says a report in the Journal of Studies on Alcohol and Drugs. Researchers accounted for several factors which influence under-age drinking, including parents’ drinking habits and any history of alcoholism, as well as tendencies among the children to be impulsive and take risks. Even then there was still a connection between early sipping and risky drinking by high school, said Dr Jackson. She said it was possible little tastes of alcohol sent young children a mixed message because some may have difficulty understanding the difference between a sip of wine and having a full drink. She stressed parents should not be alarmed if they had already let their child have a taste of wine, adding: ‘We’re not saying your child is doomed.’ Dr Paul Wallace, of the charity Drinkaware, said: ‘Alcohol can harm children while they are still developing which is why the UK chief medical officers say an alcohol-free childhood as the best option. ‘It’s best to talk to your child about the risks associated with drinking. You have more influence than you might think.’ One in five teenagers have bought or tried electronic cigarettes, a major British study has found. This includes many who had never smoked regular cigarettes. It is feared youngsters hooked on the nicotine in the devices will then move on to tobacco cigarettes, putting themselves at risk of lung cancer and other diseases. Experts warn that rather than being an aid to quitting smoking, e-cigarettes are increasingly seen as ‘a recreational drug in their own right’. Professor Mark Bellis, of Liverpool John Moores University, surveyed 16,000 people aged 14 to 17 in the North West of England. A fifth said they had bought or tried e-cigarettes. More boys than girls had done so, and the rate increased among those from deprived areas, the journal BMC Public Health reports. Professor Bellis warned nicotine can affect younger brains more seriously.\n\nSummary:', params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0,

Please output the summary only, without any other text.\n\nArticle:\nEventually he snapped, trudging off the field after 75 minutes and wondering when his next game in a Chelsea shirt will be. This has been brewing for a while, simmering in the background at a time when Jose Mourinho needs his first choice striker out on the pitch in the final, decisive nine games of the season. Diego Costa, this hot-head in a Chelsea shirt, has tweaked his hamstring again and Mourinho will expect his prized forward to barter his way out of Spain's two games during the international break. This time the complaint felt legit, particularly as the score was delicately balanced at 2-2 at the KC Stadium when Costa signalled for help. Chelsea striker Diego Costa was forced off with a hamstring injury during the Blues' 3-2 win over Hull City. Costa (left) talks to manager Jose Mourinho (right) before he is substituted at KC Stadium on Sunday. His replacement, Loic Remy, answered the SOS by scoring Chelsea's winner with his first touch. It was a shame to see Costa disappear down the tunnel, particularly after he had joined Harry Kane at the top of the scoring charts in the Barclays Premier League with a rasping effort to put Chelsea 2-0 ahead. Instead Spain, who have a Euro 2016 qualifier against Ukraine to play on Friday, and a friendly with Holland the following Tuesday will dictate when the forward plays again. Mourinho has an uneasy relationship with Spain coach Vicente del Bosque and with that in mind, his adopted country are likely to demand that he is assessed by their own doctors. 'When the team needs a goal with 15 minutes to go and the striker has a lot of experience with hamstring injuries and says it's over, it's over. 'We know his hamstring is not strong. Now he has 15 days without football, but we never cry about our injured players. 'He has had this problem since he tried to play in the Champions League final against Atletico Madrid. He has this fragility.' There has been talk of an operation at the end of the season, some serious discussions between Chelsea's medical staff about a permanent solution. 'Dr Biosca (Chelsea's medical director) is against knives, against surgery,' admitted Mourinho. 'He's all in favour of conservative work and collective work between the medical department and fitness staff. This is the direction, we believe.' Costa had scored Chelsea's second goal as they stormed into a 2-0 lead within 10 minutes on Sunday. It has been another eventful game for Costa, full of sly digs and elbows again as he responded to the prods in the back from Steve Bruce's players. Everyone tries to work him over these days. There was a flashpoint, of course there was, because that is the way Costa plays the game. He snarls, he snaps, he scores. Here at the KC Stadium, after Hull had pegged back Chelsea amid raucous scenes in the stands, he threw half an elbow in the direction of Jake Livermore. It was not seen by Michael Oliver, the referee who also failed to spot Costa raking his studs down Emre Can during the volatile Capital One Cup semi-final second leg at Stamford Bridge. On this occasion he is expected to escape. Hull were able to draw level before half-time and when Costa was subbed off the scores were locked at 2-2. The real punishment was for Hull, beaten by the boot of Remy just a couple of minutes after he had replaced Costa as a substitute. He is a useful back-up, full of energy and enthusiasm despite his lack of minutes. Mourinho had every reason to be grateful to him. 'Every time he plays here is there and he probably deserves more than I give him,' admitted a mightily relieved Mourinho. 'There are not many times when a coach owes something to a player, but with Remy that's the case. Every time he plays he gives us a lot.' After scoring the winner here for Chelsea, he has earned a break. Loic Remy scored the winning goal for Chelsea and his contributions could prove vital in Costa's absence.\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0,

Stefan Holt, who has followed in his father's footsteps and anchors the local news in Chicago, said 'Hi, Dad!' before handing over to the national host for a preview of that evening's stories. Lester responded 'proud of you' before going on to walk viewers through what was coming up later that evening. Scroll down for video. Father to son: NBC Nightly News host Lester Holt, right, shared a sweet exchanged with his son Stefan, left, who handed over to him after a 5pm newcast. The two also traded jokes about Stefan's bedtime, as the younger Holt was already 'up late' covering the evening newscast for a colleague. Indeed, both Holts crossed paths on the airwaves because they were filling in for somebody else - Lester Holt for the scandal-hit Brian WIlliams. Holt, previously the Nightly News weekend anchor, stepped up to the weeknight job after Williams was yanked off the flagship newscast by NBC bosses. It followed repeated revelations that Williams had lied about his personal involvement in stories, including being hit by an RPG over Iraq. NBC, which said he had violated the trust of their viewers, suspended Williams for six months without pay. He is one month in to the punishment. In his absence, Holt has managed to keep ratings steady at the Nightly News program. Proud of you: Lester Holt, who is filling in for scandal-hit Brian Williams, said he was proud of his son, who is following in his footsteps.\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=128, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=False, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: [128000, 9370, 5730, 553, 279, 2768, 3754, 4652, 304, 220, 4386, 11460, 13, 5321, 2612, 279, 12399, 1193, 11, 2085, 904, 1023, 1495, 382, 17064, 512, 32, 17562, 10449, 369, 24426, 596, 13120, 398, 5513, 6656, 1139, 264, 10437, 7126, 12, 942, 13123, 994, 17543, 83758, 60006, 2322, 813, 1866, 4538, 389, 38635, 13, 50002, 60006, 11, 889, 706, 8272, 304, 813, 7126, 596, 60802, 323, 56539, 279, 2254, 3754, 304, 10780, 11, 1071, 364, 13347, 11, 33621, 32483, 1603, 52588, 927, 311, 279, 5426, 3552, 369, 264, 17562, 315, 430, 11714, 596, 7493, 13, 83758, 16846, 364, 79, 43376, 315, 499, 6, 1603, 2133, 389, 311, 4321, 22511, 1555, 1148, 574, 5108, 709, 3010, 430, 11714, 13, 23198, 1523, 369, 2835, 13, 20941, 311, 4538, 25, 24426, 13120, 398, 5513, 3552, 83758, 60006, 11, 1314, 11, 6222, 264, 10437, 48501, 449, 813, 4538, 50002, 11, 2163, 11, 889, 23415, 927, 311, 1461, 1306, 264, 220, 20, 5298, 502, 3914, 13, 578, 1403, 1101, 31207, 32520, 922, 50002, 596, 89607, 11, 439, 279, 14992, 60006, 574, 2736, 364, 455, 3389, 6, 18702, 279, 11714, 502, 2445, 561, 369, 264, 37444, 13, 23150, 11, 2225, 16071, 2641, 28129, 13006, 389, 279, 3805, 58365, 1606, 814, 1051, 21973, 304, 369, 18570, 775, 482, 83758, 60006, 369, 279, 26681, 70201, 17520, 43023, 657, 12663, 13, 60006, 11, 8767, 279, 13120, 398, 5513, 9178, 17543, 11, 25319, 709, 311, 279, 2046, 9471, 2683, 1306, 13926, 574, 379, 41872, 1022, 279, 43772, 502, 2445, 561, 555, 24426, 42847, 13, 1102, 8272, 11763, 50908, 430, 13926, 1047, 47253, 922, 813, 4443, 22315, 304, 7493, 11, 2737, 1694, 4295, 555, 459, 34602, 927, 11340, 13, 24426, 11, 902, 1071, 568, 1047, 34521, 279, 7095, 315, 872, 22511, 11, 22340, 13926, 369, 4848, 4038, 2085, 2343, 13, 1283, 374, 832, 2305, 304, 311, 279, 25060, 13, 763, 813, 19821, 11, 60006, 706, 9152, 311, 2567, 18594, 24981, 520, 279, 13120, 398, 5513, 2068, 13, 84349, 315, 499, 25, 83758, 60006, 11, 889, 374, 21973, 304, 369, 26681, 70201, 17520, 13926, 11, 1071, 568, 574, 12691, 315, 813, 4538, 11, 889, 374, 2768, 304, 813, 60802, 382, 19791, 25], prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

People are actually buying it. For $89, self-styled entrepreneur Kyle Waring will ship you 6 pounds of Boston-area snow in an insulated Styrofoam box -- enough for 10 to 15 snowballs, he says. But not if you live in New England or surrounding states. "We will not ship snow to any states in the northeast!" says Waring\'s website, ShipSnowYo.com. "We\'re in the business of expunging snow!" His website and social media accounts claim to have filled more than 133 orders for snow -- more than 30 on Tuesday alone, his busiest day yet. With more than 45 total inches, Boston has set a record this winter for the snowiest month in its history. Most residents see the huge piles of snow choking their yards and sidewalks as a nuisance, but Waring saw an opportunity. According to Boston.com, it all started a few weeks ago, when Waring and his wife were shoveling deep snow from their yard in Manchester-by-the-Sea, a coastal suburb north of Boston. He joked about shipping the stuff to friends and family in warmer states, and an idea was born. His business slogan: "Our nightmare is your dream!" At first, ShipSnowYo sold snow packed into empty 16.9-ounce water bottles for $19.99, but the snow usually melted before it reached its destination. So this week, Waring began shipping larger amounts in the Styrofoam cubes, which he promises will arrive anywhere in the U.S. in less than 20 hours. He also has begun selling a 10-pound box of snow for $119. Many of his customers appear to be companies in warm-weather states who are buying the snow as a gag, he said. Whether Waring can sustain his gimmicky venture into the spring remains to be seen. But he has no shortage of product. "At this rate, it\'s going to be July until the snow melts," he told Boston.com. "But I\'ve thought about taking this idea and running with it for other seasonal items. Maybe I\'ll ship some fall foliage."\n\nSummary:', params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=128, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=False, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: [128000, 9370, 5730, 553, 279, 2768, 3754, 4652, 304, 220, 4386, 11460, 13, 5321, 2612, 279, 12399, 1193, 11, 2085, 904, 1023, 1495, 382, 17064, 512, 3100, 9944, 8, 791, 1193, 3245, 69691, 1291, 1109, 264, 7564, 304, 12056, 11130, 22108, 46329, 709, 279, 7019, 67, 727, 4251, 6392, 323, 10209, 433, 369, 6412, 2930, 30, 9029, 527, 3604, 12096, 433, 13, 1789, 400, 4578, 11, 659, 5594, 7756, 29349, 31359, 468, 3329, 690, 8448, 499, 220, 21, 16701, 315, 10406, 30122, 12056, 304, 459, 79379, 47665, 299, 831, 309, 3830, 1198, 3403, 369, 220, 605, 311, 220, 868, 12056, 46618, 11, 568, 2795, 13, 2030, 539, 422, 499, 3974, 304, 1561, 9635, 477, 14932, 5415, 13, 330, 1687, 690, 539, 8448, 12056, 311, 904, 5415, 304, 279, 41929, 9135, 2795, 468, 3329, 596, 3997, 11, 27901, 63385, 65825, 916, 13, 330, 1687, 2351, 304, 279, 2626, 315, 1367, 2234, 287, 12056, 9135, 5414, 3997, 323, 3674, 3772, 9815, 3802, 311, 617, 10409, 810, 1109, 220, 9423, 10373, 369, 12056, 1198, 810, 1109, 220, 966, 389, 7742, 7636, 11, 813, 84608, 1938, 3686, 13, 3161, 810, 1109, 220, 1774, 2860, 15271, 11, 10406, 706, 743, 264, 3335, 420, 12688, 369, 279, 12056, 13744, 2305, 304, 1202, 3925, 13, 7648, 11062, 1518, 279, 6908, 59872, 315, 12056, 91620, 872, 14006, 323, 82835, 439, 264, 77741, 11, 719, 468, 3329, 5602, 459, 6776, 13, 10771, 311, 10406, 916, 11, 433, 682, 3940, 264, 2478, 5672, 4227, 11, 994, 468, 3329, 323, 813, 7555, 1051, 559, 869, 20659, 5655, 12056, 505, 872, 20085, 304, 19922, 14656, 10826, 12, 60261, 11, 264, 35335, 52265, 10411, 315, 10406, 13, 1283, 68329, 922, 11862, 279, 6392, 311, 4885, 323, 3070, 304, 46039, 5415, 11, 323, 459, 4623, 574, 9405, 13, 5414, 2626, 52637, 25, 330, 8140, 38911, 374, 701, 8063, 9135, 2468, 1176, 11, 27901, 63385, 65825, 6216, 12056, 19937, 1139, 4384, 220, 845, 13, 24, 12, 9933, 3090, 27474, 369, 400, 777, 13, 1484, 11, 719, 279, 12056, 6118, 50459, 1603, 433, 8813, 1202, 9284, 13, 2100, 420, 2046, 11, 468, 3329, 6137, 11862, 8294, 15055, 304, 279, 47665, 299, 831, 309, 55204, 11, 902, 568, 21300, 690, 17782, 12660, 304, 279, 549, 815, 13, 304, 2753, 1109, 220, 508, 4207, 13, 1283, 1101, 706, 22088, 11486, 264, 220, 605, 48730, 3830, 315, 12056, 369, 400, 9079, 13, 9176, 315, 813, 6444, 5101, 311, 387, 5220, 304, 8369, 12, 15561, 5415, 889, 527, 12096, 279, 12056, 439, 264, 46692, 11, 568, 1071, 13, 13440, 468, 3329, 649, 14201, 813, 75873, 19501, 26255, 1139, 279, 10683, 8625, 311, 387, 3970, 13, 2030, 568, 706, 912, 39259, 315, 2027, 13, 330, 1688, 420, 4478, 11, 433, 596, 2133, 311, 387, 5887, 3156, 279, 12056, 99191, 1359, 568, 3309, 10406, 916, 13, 330, 4071, 358, 3077, 3463, 922, 4737, 420, 4623, 323, 4401, 449, 433, 369, 1023, 36899, 3673, 13, 10926, 358, 3358, 8448, 1063, 4498, 80105, 2266, 19791, 25], prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

The list, which was on Hernandez's Blackberry, contains mostly football related tasks, like purchasing fish oil, watching game film and memorizing the playbook, but also says'send rounds.' And according to Kyle Aspinwall, who works for Glock and is testifying for the prosecution, this is another way of saying purchase ammunition. Scroll down for video. Former New England Patriots football player Aaron Hernandez, left, speaks with his defense attorney Charles Rankin, right, during his murder trial Thursda. Kyle Aspinwall, an employee of Glock firearms manufacturer, examines a pistol while testifying during the murder trial. The list also included 'troll,' a form of online harassment generally popular among teenagers. This as the jury was asked to disregard some of the expert testimony delivered by Aspinwall on Wednesday when he claimed that Hernandez could be seen holding a gun on security footage from inside his home both\xa0before\xa0and after the time Lloyd is believed to have been killed. Superior Court Judge Susan Garsh said that jurors were to disregard some of the identifying characteristics of the gun Aspinwall testified to, and also reminded them that he was speaking to his opinion, which they could accept or disregard. Aspinwall said Hernandez appeared to be carrying a Glock in his residence around 3:30am on June 17, just minutes after Lloyd was killed in a nearby industrial park with what the prosecution claims was a\xa0.45-caliber Glock handgun. When questioned by the defense however, Aspinwall said he could not say if the gun was a functioning gun or even a pellet gun. Hernandez looks on as a still frame from surveillance video is displayed on a monitor during his murder trial in. The defense also went after him by pointing out that if it was indeed a gun, Hernandez would have to be holding it by the muzzle, something that would be incredibly unsafe should the weapon accidentally fire. Hernandez, 25, has pleaded not guilty the to murder of Lloyd. He is also charged in another case with the murder of two Boston men in 2012 after a brief encounter at a nightclub. He has pleaded not guilty in that case too.\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=128, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=False, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: [128000, 9370, 5730, 553, 279, 2768, 3754, 4652, 304, 220, 4386, 11460, 13, 5321, 2612, 279, 12399, 1193, 11, 2085, 904, 1023, 1495, 382, 17064, 512, 94277, 1105, 389, 7950, 1051, 6982, 264, 311, 30659, 1160, 5439, 555, 4846, 1561, 9635, 33617, 6917, 26757, 54521, 20193, 1603, 10102, 11996, 92173, 46296, 574, 6689, 5710, 13, 578, 1160, 11, 902, 574, 389, 54521, 596, 5348, 15717, 11, 5727, 10213, 9141, 5552, 9256, 11, 1093, 23395, 7795, 5707, 11, 10307, 1847, 4632, 323, 16420, 4954, 279, 87153, 11, 719, 1101, 2795, 596, 408, 20101, 3238, 1628, 4184, 311, 31359, 1666, 13576, 16836, 11, 889, 4375, 369, 100080, 323, 374, 1296, 7922, 369, 279, 32699, 11, 420, 374, 2500, 1648, 315, 5605, 7782, 37768, 13, 23198, 1523, 369, 2835, 13, 33600, 1561, 9635, 33617, 9141, 2851, 26757, 54521, 11, 2163, 11, 21881, 449, 813, 9232, 14065, 15274, 19856, 258, 11, 1314, 11, 2391, 813, 10102, 9269, 83785, 3315, 13, 31359, 1666, 13576, 16836, 11, 459, 9548, 315, 100080, 32653, 14290, 11, 49095, 264, 40536, 1418, 1296, 7922, 2391, 279, 10102, 9269, 13, 578, 1160, 1101, 5343, 364, 83, 1119, 2965, 264, 1376, 315, 2930, 26425, 8965, 5526, 4315, 37719, 13, 1115, 439, 279, 21928, 574, 4691, 311, 58817, 1063, 315, 279, 6335, 24365, 12886, 555, 1666, 13576, 16836, 389, 8079, 994, 568, 11922, 430, 54521, 1436, 387, 3970, 10168, 264, 6166, 389, 4868, 22609, 505, 4871, 813, 2162, 2225, 4194, 15145, 4194, 438, 1306, 279, 892, 46296, 374, 11846, 311, 617, 1027, 7577, 13, 42041, 7301, 20819, 31033, 12471, 939, 1071, 430, 73139, 1051, 311, 58817, 1063, 315, 279, 25607, 17910, 315, 279, 6166, 1666, 13576, 16836, 39873, 311, 11, 323, 1101, 31256, 1124, 430, 568, 574, 12365, 311, 813, 9647, 11, 902, 814, 1436, 4287, 477, 58817, 13, 1666, 13576, 16836, 1071, 54521, 9922, 311, 387, 15691, 264, 100080, 304, 813, 22423, 2212, 220, 18, 25, 966, 309, 389, 5651, 220, 1114, 11, 1120, 4520, 1306, 46296, 574, 7577, 304, 264, 14373, 13076, 6246, 449, 1148, 279, 32699, 8349, 574, 264, 4194, 13, 1774, 49236, 8799, 100080, 57905, 13, 3277, 29440, 555, 279, 9232, 4869, 11, 1666, 13576, 16836, 1071, 568, 1436, 539, 2019, 422, 279, 6166, 574, 264, 31301, 6166, 477, 1524, 264, 68510, 6166, 13, 54521, 5992, 389, 439, 264, 2103, 4124, 505, 22156, 2835, 374, 12882, 389, 264, 8891, 2391, 813, 10102, 9269, 304, 13, 578, 9232, 1101, 4024, 1306, 1461, 555, 22364, 704, 430, 422, 433, 574, 13118, 264, 6166, 11, 54521, 1053, 617, 311, 387, 10168, 433, 555, 279, 75329, 11, 2555, 430, 1053, 387, 17235, 20451, 1288, 279, 10500, 33484, 4027, 13, 54521, 11, 220, 914, 11, 706, 40001, 539, 16390, 279, 311, 10102, 315, 46296, 13, 1283, 374, 1101, 11684, 304, 2500, 1162, 449, 279, 10102, 315, 1403, 10406, 3026, 304, 220, 679, 17, 1306, 264, 10015, 13123, 520, 264, 70832, 13, 1283, 706, 40001, 539, 16390, 304, 430, 1162, 2288, 382, 19791, 25], prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

Visualising the joy of completing the journey back to the top flight is something he wants all now under his command at Rangers to do. The power of positive thinking will be deployed in the fight for promotion McCall took on Thursday evening. The 50-year-old stepped down from his post at Fir Park in November after admitting much soul-searching in a bid to halt a form slump. New Rangers manager Stuart McCall raises the club scarf after being unveiled on Thursday afternoon. The new Rangers boss takes his first training session at Murray Park on Thursday afternoon. His was surely a classic case of becoming a victim of your own success. Hindsight only makes the prior back-to-back second places finishes he attained on a meagre budget look all the more incredible. Revitalised, refreshed and fully motivated, the lure of resuming his managerial career with a return to Ibrox was simply too great to resist. McCall’s current deal only runs to the end of the season but if his infectious enthusiasm can transform an underachieving, down-in-the mouth squad into play-off victors then his claim for a longer stay will be extremely difficult to ignore. He won six titles and five cups in seven years as a midfielder with Walter Smith’s all-conquering side of the 1990s, but reckons taking Rangers up this season might well be the greatest achievement of his footballing life. ‘It would have to be up there and I have been quite fortunate in my time,’ he mused. ‘Yeah, I suppose it would be. ‘There might still be sleepless nights but it is something to dream about. I want the lads to have a focus about that. Picture yourself running around Ibrox having won promotion. The former Motherwell manager has taken charge of the Ibrox club for the rest of the season. The former Bradford player faces the press as he is unveiled on Thursday. ‘The lads who have been here have done it for two years. Obviously the circumstances were quite different. ‘I would think at this moment in time - and I am not putting the boot into the players because they know this themselves - anyone who has watched Rangers for the last three or four months would say they would struggle. ‘But there are enough good players in the squad I saw as I looked around in our meeting today. ‘They wouldn’t be at Rangers if they weren’t good players. I saw flashes of it today in training. Go and express yourself. All of the players who have come from all these different clubs, I would have signed most of them. ‘It hasn’t sunk in and it won’t sink in for a while. But I’m going to make the most of it.’ McCall believes his new charges still have what it takes and, clearly, he wouldn’t have been getting to grips with a new office in Murray Park if he didn’ t think he could work a little magic alongside trusted assistant Kenny Black. ‘When I got the opportunity, I thought about the whole thing last night,’ said McCall, reflecting on the whirlwind of events that led to him replacing caretaker manager Kenny McDowall, who has made an amicable exit. ‘In an ideal world you will come in for pre-season and have four-six weeks to look at players, try different systems, and look at strengths and weaknesses. That’s obviously not going to happen and I will have to hit the ground running. ‘But just being out on the training ground again gave me a buzz and I’m relishing it. The results have got to be right, of course. ‘There have only been 13 managers in about 123 years so for me to be given the opportunity is beyond belief. ‘I got a nice text from my daughter pointing out that I had played and managed Bradford. I have played for Scotland and worked on the management team and now I’m managing Rangers having played for them. ‘I want to make it a success. I’m not an over-confident person. I know it will be a struggle and I will beat myself up every day but I will do my best.’ Rangers announced that caretaker manager Kenny McDowall has left the club ahead of a new appointmnet. McCall (centre right) celebrates the 1992 SPL during his Rangers playing days with the Ibrox club. He inherits a squad where a dozen first-team players are coming to the end of their contracts but insists that should only add to the shared motivation to stick around a while longer. ‘This club might not know until May 30 what league they are going to be playing in next season. ‘So regardless of who is manager, I don’t think contracts are going to be handed out at this moment in time. ‘I’m sure Hearts will be handing out contracts to a lot of players, because they know they are going to be in the Premiership next season and they deserve to. ‘So the message to the lads out of contract here is “go and and earn yourself one”. They can still turn it around. ‘If they play well and we do well as a team, is there a possibility I might be here next season? Yes, it’s a possibility. But it’s down to themselves if they are here. It’s still in their hands.’ McCall will open his tenure with tomorrow’s home game against Livingston as he seeks to eat into the five-point lead Hibernian currently have in second place. What, though, if Rangers can battle through to the play-off final and have to meet his old love Motherwell to complete the job? ‘It would make me sick,’ he grimaced. ‘It would. But I honestly hope – and believe – they won’t be in the bottom two. ‘I’ve had a lot of texts from the Motherwell lads. I think the signings of McDonald and Pearson coming back will really help them and I think there is enough there. ‘There is no guarantee we are going to be in there but that is the aim. I want to be playing that 11th team at the end of the season. I just hope it’s not Motherwell and I’m confident they are good enough to get out of it.’ McCall will take a sabbatical from his role in Gordon Strachan’s backroom staff for the matches against Northern Ireland and Gibraltar later this month as he focuses on his short-term challenge. The future beyond that remains unclear – with a longer appointment at Ibrox almost certainly meaning his exit from the national set-up - but he insisted the former Celtic manager had been a source of sage advice. ‘I didn’t make any decision until I spoke to Gordon Strachan,’ he added. ‘I spoke to him about 6.30pm the other night. He had just come off the golf course in Spain and he said: “I take it it’s about the Rangers job?” ‘He was fantastic. I won’t go into what he said, but his advice was terrific. He has really helped since I have been working with Scotland. I didn’t know him until he offered me the post out of the blue. ‘I won’t be involved in the Northern Ireland and Gibraltar games but who knows what might happen in the future.’\n\nSummary:', params:

In what was one of the Kremlin's biggest shows of force since its ties with the West plunged to Cold War-lows, the exercises seemed to be aimed at dwarfing Nato drills in neighbouring Norway. President Mr Putin - who has promised to spend more than 21 trillion roubles (£228billion) by the end of the decade to overhaul Russia's fighting forces - called the fleet to full combat readiness. Full combat readiness: Russian President Vladimir Putin (pictured yesterday) has promised to spend more than 21 trillion roubles (£228billion) by the end of the decade to overhaul Russia's fighting forces. The country’s defence minister Sergei Shoigu said: ‘New challenges and threats to military security require the armed forces to further boost their military capabilities.’ ‘Special attention must be paid to newly created strategic formations in the north.’ Mr Putin made his first public appearance since March 5 yesterday - an absence from view that had fuelled feverish speculation over his health as well as his grip on power. He was meeting Kyrgyz President Almazbek Atambayev at the Constantine Palace outside Russia's second city of St Petersburg. Flag: The exercises are due to last for much of the week during which Russia will celebrate its annexation of the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea (pictured yesterday in Simferopol) Norway is currently holding its ‘Joint Viking’ drills involving 5,000 troops in Finnmark county, which borders Russia in the resource-rich Arctic circle where both countries are vying for influence. Tensions between Russia and Europe worsened last year, leading eight northern European nations to promise to boost cooperation to counter an increase in Moscow's military activity. Nato made new allegations last week that Russia was arming separatists in east Ukraine, where more than 6,000 people have been killed in nearly a year of fighting. The West and Kiev accuse Russia of supplying arms and soldiers to support the pro-Russian separatists. Moscow denies the claims. Talks: Mr Putin (right) was meeting Kyrgyz President Almazbek Atambayev (left) at the Constantine Palace outside Russia's second city of St Petersburg yesterday. Nato says it counted more than 100 intercepts of Russian planes into members' airspace last year, three times more than in 2013. The intercepts have forced civilian planes to change their courses and Britain scrambled Typhoon interceptor planes after two long-range bombers flew over the English Channel. Norway said its military drills had been planned before the Ukraine crisis. ‘However, the current security situation in Europe shows that the exercise is more relevant than ever,’ Lieutenant General Haga Lunde said. The Russian exercises are due to last for much of the week during which Russia will celebrate its annexation of the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea, carried out with the help of special forces.\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=128, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=False, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: [128000, 9370, 5730, 553, 279, 2768, 3754, 4652, 304, 220, 4386, 11460, 13, 5321, 2612, 279, 12399, 1193, 11, 2085, 904, 1023, 1495, 382, 17064, 512, 53, 18599, 31204, 21810, 706, 2231, 389, 264, 1501, 315, 8524, 596, 6411, 8333, 1306, 29905, 3876, 279, 4553, 364, 72191, 44555, 6, 315, 220, 1774, 11, 931, 17312, 11, 220, 3174, 18198, 11, 220, 868, 86642, 323, 220, 5120, 14467, 13, 763, 1148, 574, 832, 315, 279, 51424, 596, 8706, 5039, 315, 5457, 2533, 1202, 20405, 449, 279, 4410, 75803, 311, 24062, 5111, 2922, 4336, 11, 279, 23783, 9508, 311, 387, 20034, 520, 50561, 287, 452, 4428, 57648, 304, 62027, 32603, 13, 4900, 4491, 21810, 482, 889, 706, 19487, 311, 8493, 810, 1109, 220, 1691, 32610, 436, 86713, 54915, 14261, 65, 15068, 8, 555, 279, 842, 315, 279, 13515, 311, 52774, 8524, 596, 11039, 8603, 482, 2663, 279, 26155, 311, 2539, 12896, 62792, 13, 8797, 12896, 62792, 25, 8690, 4900, 36011, 21810, 320, 69389, 13985, 8, 706, 19487, 311, 8493, 810, 1109, 220, 1691, 32610, 436, 86713, 54915, 14261, 65, 15068, 8, 555, 279, 842, 315, 279, 13515, 311, 52774, 8524, 596, 11039, 8603, 13, 578, 3224, 753, 23682, 13015, 85098, 64040, 27843, 1071, 25, 3451, 3648, 11774, 323, 18208, 311, 6411, 4868, 1397, 279, 17903, 8603, 311, 4726, 7916, 872, 6411, 17357, 14639, 3451, 20989, 6666, 2011, 387, 7318, 311, 13945, 3549, 19092, 62264, 304, 279, 10411, 14639, 4491, 21810, 1903, 813, 1176, 586, 11341, 2533, 5587, 220, 20, 13985, 482, 459, 19821, 505, 1684, 430, 1047, 10633, 839, 34653, 819, 33422, 927, 813, 2890, 439, 1664, 439, 813, 25703, 389, 2410, 13, 1283, 574, 6574, 23727, 99962, 4900, 1708, 102705, 77614, 2468, 3042, 352, 5230, 520, 279, 19863, 483, 31396, 4994, 8524, 596, 2132, 3363, 315, 800, 55048, 13, 23497, 25, 578, 23783, 527, 4245, 311, 1566, 369, 1790, 315, 279, 2046, 2391, 902, 8524, 690, 18890, 1202, 54368, 367, 315, 279, 34725, 66495, 315, 61811, 320, 69389, 13985, 304, 4567, 809, 28765, 8, 32603, 374, 5131, 10168, 1202, 3451, 42097, 65450, 529, 57648, 16239, 220, 20, 11, 931, 17312, 304, 35162, 4075, 14189, 11, 902, 24743, 8524, 304, 279, 5211, 41947, 37518, 12960, 1405, 2225, 5961, 527, 348, 7169, 369, 10383, 13, 350, 4769, 1990, 8524, 323, 4606, 47293, 6901, 1566, 1060, 11, 6522, 8223, 18671, 7665, 17089, 311, 11471, 311, 7916, 23915, 311, 5663, 459, 5376, 304, 23223, 596, 6411, 5820, 13, 452, 4428, 1903, 502, 18873, 1566, 2046, 430, 8524, 574, 802, 5424, 62482, 1705, 304, 11226, 19278, 11, 1405, 810, 1109, 220, 21, 11, 931, 1274, 617, 1027, 7577, 304, 7154, 264, 1060, 315, 11039, 13, 578, 4410, 323, 62725, 62742, 8524, 315, 44413, 11977, 323, 15201, 311, 1862, 279, 463, 85135, 62482, 1705, 13, 23223, 47591, 279, 8349, 13, 81547, 25, 4491, 21810, 320, 1315, 8, 574, 6574, 23727, 99962, 4900, 1708, 102705, 77614, 2468, 3042, 352, 5230, 320, 2414, 8, 520, 279, 19863, 483, 31396, 4994, 8524, 596, 2132, 3363, 315, 800, 55048, 13985, 13, 452, 4428, 2795, 433, 31094, 810, 1109, 220, 1041, 29739, 82, 315, 8690, 25761, 1139, 3697, 6, 88282, 1566, 1060, 11, 2380, 3115, 810, 1109, 304, 220, 679, 18, 13, 578, 29739, 82, 617, 9770, 30028, 25761, 311, 2349, 872, 14307, 323, 13527, 71578, 14221, 78149, 78045, 25761, 1306, 1403, 1317, 31608, 69920, 32122, 927, 279, 6498, 13740, 13, 32603, 1071, 1202, 6411, 57648, 1047, 1027, 13205, 1603, 279, 19278, 11501, 13, 3451, 11458, 11, 279, 1510, 4868, 6671, 304, 4606, 5039, 430, 279, 10368, 374, 810, 9959, 1109, 3596, 23189, 55237, 3331, 473, 12748, 445, 29965, 1071, 13, 578, 8690, 23783, 527, 4245, 311, 1566, 369, 1790, 315, 279, 2046, 2391, 902, 8524, 690, 18890, 1202, 54368, 367, 315, 279, 34725, 66495, 315, 61811, 11, 11953, 704, 449, 279, 1520, 315, 3361, 8603, 382, 19791, 25], prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

Scroll down for video. Actress Meili Cady (abve) was just a small-town girl aspiring to be an actress in Los Angeles, but was lured into a life of crime by 'Pot Princess' and alleged Samsung heiress Lisette Lee, she claims in her new book. Cady (left), who appeared in Californication and Chick Magnet, said she became enchanted with the extravagant lifestyle of Lee. But she realized too late when she was taken into custody by DEA agents in connection to Lee's illegal smuggling of weed into the Midwest. On a day in June 2010, the private jet her best friend had leased headed for Columbus, Ohio had 13 suitcases filled with weed. And as Lee's personal assistant, she never knew the reality behind the glamorous life of the 'Gangster Princess', as named by the Rolling Stone, was closely entangled in a web of lies and manipulation that would leave her facing 40 years in prison. It was estimated that during 14 trips made to Ohio, Lee had transported 7,000 pounds of pot and made a profit of $3million. Lee was sentenced to six years, while Cady received 30 days in custody and one year of home confinement after making a deal with prosecutors. It all began when she left Washington State at 19 years old and headed for California where she worked part-time jobs to support herself and pursued her dreams by enrolling for classes at an acting studio. A friend from the studio introduced her to Lee, an aspiring Korean pop star who dropped out of Harvard and called herself the 'Korean Paris Hilton', and though Cady was hesitant to befriend an heiress who had to seek  friends, she was lonely. And as Lee's personal assistant, she never knew the reality behind the glamorous life of the 'Gangster Princess', as named by the Rolling Stone, was closely entangled in a web of lies and manipulation that would leave her facing 40 years in prison (above Lisettee Lee, left, with Cady, right) Lee (left) was sentenced to six years, while Cady (right) received 30 days in custody and one year of home confinement after making a deal with prosecutors. It was estimated that during 14 trips made to Ohio, Lee had transported 7,000 pounds of pot and made a profit of $3million (above the 13 suitcases filled with marijuana) Following her release from prison, she spent a year under house arrest and was forced to wear an ankle monitor while confined in her apartment. Lee's Japanese father was a big player at Sony and her Korean mother was the granddaughter of the founder of Samsung - so the luxury condo she lived in along with the purple Mercedes all made sense to Cady. And when she was struggling financially, Lee offered her a job as personal assistant, as she needed the help while 'embarking on a new business venture'. While Lee was vague on the details, Cady took the job with her first assignment pretending to be a wealthy diva who was particular about the way her luggage was loaded onto the plane at the Van Nuys airport in California. Cady learned later that she was risking arrest for Lee who feared it, as she was sent on the drug-smuggling flight in her place. But on her fourth flight, when Cady (above) complained about the smell of marijuana in the cabin, she finally understood that luggage was actually filled with drugs - and that she was an accessory in a major criminal operation. But she nearly made a fatal mistake after offering to help with the suitcases on her second flight, which she was scolded for by Lee. This along with other jobs including making large wire transfers under her own name left her confused about her role as Lee's personal assistant. On her fourth flight, when she complained about the smell of marijuana in the cabin, she finally understood that luggage was actually filled with drugs - and that she was an accessory in a major criminal operation. In the book, which is out on March 24, Cady revealed that even though the truth came out, she remained silent and was arrested along with Lee in Columbus by federal agents in 2010. In the end, during the trial, Cady learned the truth - Lee had been fostered as a small child, and was the illegitimate daughter of a Samsung heiress and a Japanese father who owned casinos. Film director Craig Brewer, a Sundance winner for 2005 film Hustle and Flow, is considering making a movie based on Lee’s life.\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0,

With some 8,500 laborers working around the clock on its construction, the imposingly-named dam is surely one of Africa\'s most ambitious infrastructure projects, reaffirming Ethiopia\'s ambitions of becoming a big regional player and a major exporter of power. When completed, the project will generate around 6,000 megawatts of electricity for both domestic use and exports. The most striking aspect of the nearly $5 billion enterprise is, however, that it is entirely funded by Ethiopia, without any foreign investment. According to the authorities, 20% of the project is financed from bond offerings to Ethiopians, and the remaining 80% from tax collection. "It was seen as a strategically important initiative that the government and the Ethiopian people are financing it 100%," says Zemedeneh Negatu, managing partner at Ernst & Young Ethiopia. "They have come up with a very creative and innovative way that I think will be a lesson for other African countries who want to embark on such large infrastructure projects, and want to have the flexibility to do it themselves," he adds. Hydroelectric powerhouse. So far, Ethiopians at home and abroad have contributed about $350 million, and the government says that the 170 meter tall dam is on track for a 2017 opening, with 40% of the work already complete. Ethiopia\'s per capita income might be one of the lowest in the world, but the country has enjoyed an impressive economic growth since 2000, averaging 10.9% annually, which has resulted in a 33% reduction of people living in poverty. If the Grand Renaissance Dam and other hydroelectric projects, such as the Gibe III dam on the Omo river, are completed on time, The World Bank estimates Ethiopia could earn $1 billion a year from electricity exports. Negatu says that this would make the country the largest exporter of power in Africa, and second only to South Africa when it comes to installed capacity. Unhappy neighbors. Yet, not everyone is happy about Ethiopia\'s energetic drive to harness its water resources. The Grand Renaissance Dam is being built on Blue Nile, a tributary of the Nile River which has been powering the agriculture of Sudan and Egypt -- through which it flows -- for millennia. These countries have opposed the project in the past, fearing that the dam will reduce their share of the Nile water. The ousted Egyptian president Mohamed Morsi had even threatened to defend "each drop of Nile water with our blood if necessary" back in 2013. Passions have been calmer more recently, and today the Reuters news agency reported that representatives of Egypt, Sudan and Ethiopia reached a preliminary agreement  in Khartoum on how to operate the dam. Negatu is convinced that a compromise will be reached, as he thinks that the dam will ultimately benefit not just Ethiopia but most other East African nations. "This is actually a regional project because up from Egypt all the way down to Rwanda, countries are going to buy the power that\'s generated by this dam," Negatu says, adding that both Rwanda and Kenya have already agreed to purchase thousands of megawatts once the project is finished. A lack of reliable power has long stunted Africa\'s development, with 600 million people on the continent not connected to the grid and getting by on a mix of generators, kerosene lamps and candles. In Ethiopia, only 15 to 20% of the population has access to power according to a study by Chatham House. "It\'s Africa\'s Achilles\' heel," says Negatu. "With anyone who wants to build a factory in Africa, the first thing they ask is infrastructure, and within infrastructure, whether there is sufficient electricity. Industrialization has always been about electricity, and this [dam] addresses this basic need." He adds that, after depending on exporting raw commodities for decades, governments across Africa should be pursuing a strategy of industrialization, following the example of China. "We\'ve got to move up the value chain, and it\'s what Ethiopia is doing right now. Its strategy is industrial-based -- not to export commodities but to manufacture value-added things, and other African nations are trying to emulate that. But without electricity there won\'t be industrialization in Africa." More from Africa View. Read this: New railway links to transform West Africa.

The existing planes have been in service since 1991 and the military argue that they're getting too old and need to be replaced. They've requested $102 million from Congress this year to help buy the planes, with the figure growing to more than $3 billion over the next five years. Scroll down for video. The Pentagon is set to spend billions on three new Air Force One planes to replace the existing two Boeing 747s currently used by the president, pictured above. The military has requested $102 million from Congress this year to buy the planes, with the figure growing to more than $3 billion over the next five years. Those numbers don't include the final three years of the project, reports CBS News. While some may question whether taxpayers can afford to buy the new planes, Air Force Col. Amy McCain argues that they can't afford not to. 'It's the only 747-200 left in the United States that is flying. So it costs a lot more time and money to keep that airplane flying than it used to. It's actually cheaper in the long run to replace it,' she said. 'The top priority is an affordable aircraft that will meet the presidential requirements,' said McCain, who is in charge of ordering the new Air Force One. 'We're buying up to three. It depends on all the availability of having two airplanes available for the president at any one time.' The Air Force hopes to sign the first contract with Boeing later this year. The goal is to have the new planes flying the president by 2023. The Air Force hopes to sign the first contract with Boeing later this year for the next Air Force One and the goal is to have the new 747s flying the president  in 2023. At six stories tall and two-thirds the size of a football field, the Air Force One is the most recognizable aircraft in the world. At six stories tall and two-thirds the size of a football field, Air Force One is the most recognizable aircraft in the world. In January the Air Force announced its intention to use Boeing's 747-8 airframe. The long-range, wide-body aircraft is made in Everett, Washington.\xa0It comes with a longer fuselage, greater wing span and new engines and avionics. It will be heavily modified with all of the latest technological and security gear. Once the new planes are introduced, the current Air Force One will go to the National Museum of the U.S. Air Force in Dayton, Ohio, home to nine previous presidential aircraft.

Criminals have stolen account numbers, addresses and phone numbers from the phone and broadband firm’s computers. The details have been used in attempts to scam hundreds of customers so far, with one man having £2,800 stolen from his bank account. Masquerading as TalkTalk staff, the fraudsters phone their victims and try to make them disclose their bank details. It is not known how many of these customers were successfully tricked and had money stolen from them. The company, which has four million customers in all, has now sent an email to every one to warn them of the ruse. One of the techniques used by the fraudsters is to offer their victims a credit in return for their bank details. The customer then finds that their account has been emptied. The fraudulent callers are convincing because they have the customer’s details to hand. TalkTalk claims only a few thousand account details have gone astray. The data theft came to light when the company investigated a sudden rise in complaints about scam calls between October and December. TalkTalk insisted it had not been hacked and that the leak came instead from a third party contractor which had legitimate access to customer accounts. Customers have taken to the company’s internet forum to air their grievances. One, who received a call from a suspected scammer, said a more prominent warning about the hacking incident should have been given earlier and ‘not hidden away at the bottom of a lengthy marketing email’. ‘Hacking is a worldwide problem – it happens and you have to let us know immediately, not hide it away,’ he wrote. ‘My 85-year-old mother who is a TT customer could well have been taken in when the guy quoted all the correct info.’ Another angry customer wrote: ‘After months and months of being lied to by TalkTalk you are now finally admitting that you have had a security breach and that our details were accessed from your database.’ He said several members of staff had denied there was a problem, adding: ‘You should be ashamed of yourselves as it is your customers who have suffered and in some cases like my own, have suffered financially.’ Another wrote on the forum: ‘This internet provider must have the worst security and data protection for its customers in the business.’ The company says it was not hacked but that the details were stolen by a third party. It investigated following a new wave of complaints last year. A further disgruntled customer accused TalkTalk of conducting a damage limitation exercise: ‘It’s only taken them months to decide to come out and let customers know, or should I say forced to come out and let them know, as they had no option as word spread.’ Others highlighted problems of dealing with call centres in India. In a statement, TalkTalk said: ‘We have become aware that some limited, non-sensitive information about some customers could have been illegally accessed in violation of our security procedures. ‘We are aware of a small, but nonetheless significant, number of customers who have been directly targeted by these criminals and we have been supporting them directly.’ The firm said the problem had also been reported to the Information Commissioner’s Office. Graeme Smith had £2,800 stolen from him but claim neither his bank nor TalkTalk will reimburse him. Graeme Smith told yesterday how his bank and TalkTalk have refused to refund him £2,815 stolen from his current account. The 61-year-old HR expert was fooled by ‘extremely slick and believable’ fraudsters who claimed to be from a TalkTalk fraud department probing computer hacking. He was kept on the phone for hours by the team of three criminals and tricked into allowing them access to his computer to remove a bug supposedly left by a hacker. They told him he would receive a £250 credit for his trouble. When he later checked his account at a cash machine the £2,815 had gone. ‘I feel like a fool – I’m not naive, but they completely took me in,’ said Mr Smith, from Chester-le-Street, County Durham. ‘I’m extremely fed up and frustrated with TalkTalk and will be leaving them in future. 'They have not provided me with any support at all and I’ve been forced to wait for days for anyone to contact me.\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0,

Please output the summary only, without any other text.\n\nArticle:\nThe bidding war for the British television rights for the Fight of the Century is coming to its climax. Sky Sports have been considered favourites to screen Floyd Mayweather versus Manny Pacquiao since their $300 million purse deal was struck for May 2 in Las Vegas. They appeared to have moved firmly into pole position when given access to Mayweather’s gym in Las Vegas prior to joining the battery of cameras at the official red carpet launch of the promotion in Los Angeles. The rights to broadcast Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao's May 2 bout in the UK is to be decided. Sky Sports appeared to be in the box seat for the rights when given access to Mayweather's Las Vegas gym. However, Frank Warren's BoxNation remains in contention with a potentially innovative package. Their film of those events and interviews feature in their Ringside programme this very Thursday evening. However, it is understood that Frank Warren has been in urgent discussions with Mayweather’s own promotion company and Pacquiao’s Top Rank promoters overnight on Wednesday. Warren has built a strong relationship with the Americans while screening a steady flow of major fights in the US on his dedicated BoxNation channel, including Mayweather and Pacquiao bouts. All the major players in the Mayweather-Pacquiao Fight of the Century pose on stage on Wednesday night. Mayweather and Pacquiao will be the richest fight ever and set the UK broadcasters alone back at least £12m.

With 12 months to run on his current deal, the Parkhead side believe they could land the 23-year-old for a fee of around £400,000. As of yet, however, there has been no contact between the clubs. The SPL champions expect to lose Dutch central defender Virgil van Dijk, with Sunderland and Southampton long-term admirers. Hearts captain Danny Wilson (right) is a summer transfer target for Celtic and could be signed for £400,000. Celtic will face a challenge to keep hold of the services of highly-rated Dutch defender\xa0Virgil van Dijk. A former Rangers protégé and Scottish Young Player of the Year, Wilson’s career stalled following a £2million move to Liverpool. However, the Edinburgh-born defender has since made 80 appearances for Hearts, the club clinching promotion with seven games to spare. Coach Ronny Deila also faces an uphill battle to convince Manchester City and Jason Denayer the defender should spend another season in Glasgow. Celtic are also tracking the Dutch market closely. An interest in NAC Breda’s Menno Koch has been shelved after the defender suffered a cruciate ligament injury, but PSV’s Belgian winger Zakaria Bakkali is available on freedom of contract. Reports also claim Parkhead scouts are watching NEC Nijmegen’s Iranian wide man Alijera Jahanbakhsh. Midfielder Liam Henderson, meanwhile, has joined Norwegian club Rosenborg on a three-month loan deal. Celtic will want to retain the services of on-loan defender\xa0Jason Denayer (left) for at least another season. PSV winger\xa0Zakaria Bakkali is another target for the SPL champions and is available on a free transfer. Their manager Kare Ingebrigtsen welcomed the move after describing the Under-19 international as ‘one of Scotland’s greatest talents and a very exciting player’. Ingebrigtsen - who spoke to Celtic boss Ronny Deila and midfielder Stefan Johansen before making his move, added: ‘Liam has huge potential and both Ronny and Stefan speak very highly about him. ‘He is a young, ambitious, hard-working boy with a strong will to win and experience of playing in front of 60,000 spectators, so he knows what the pressure of expectation is.’ Celtic's 18-year-old midfielder Liam Henderson has joined Norwegian club Rosenborg on a three-month loan.\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=128, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=False, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: [128000, 9370, 5730, 553, 279, 2768, 3754, 4652, 304, 220, 4386, 11460, 13, 5321, 2612, 279, 12399, 1193, 11, 2085, 904, 1023, 1495, 382, 17064, 512, 34, 3903, 292, 617, 9277, 53876, 24862, 33699, 17882, 389, 264, 1160, 315, 4754, 7474, 99600, 13, 3161, 220, 717, 4038, 311, 1629, 389, 813, 1510, 3568, 11, 279, 5657, 2025, 3185, 4510, 814, 1436, 4363, 279, 220, 1419, 4771, 6418, 369, 264, 11307, 315, 2212, 7083, 3443, 11, 931, 13, 1666, 315, 3686, 11, 4869, 11, 1070, 706, 1027, 912, 3729, 1990, 279, 19424, 13, 578, 65800, 34838, 1755, 311, 9229, 24113, 8792, 29315, 9734, 61887, 5355, 423, 19275, 11, 449, 83765, 323, 62251, 1317, 9860, 63698, 388, 13, 53876, 24862, 33699, 17882, 320, 1315, 8, 374, 264, 7474, 8481, 2218, 369, 55764, 323, 1436, 387, 8667, 369, 7083, 3443, 11, 931, 13, 55764, 690, 3663, 264, 8815, 311, 2567, 3412, 315, 279, 3600, 315, 7701, 55985, 24113, 29315, 4194, 50135, 61887, 5355, 423, 19275, 13, 362, 4846, 34287, 1760, 19395, 978, 323, 27188, 13566, 7460, 315, 279, 9941, 11, 17882, 753, 7076, 68941, 2768, 264, 7083, 17, 59413, 3351, 311, 25715, 13, 4452, 11, 279, 41406, 40260, 29315, 706, 2533, 1903, 220, 1490, 27351, 369, 53876, 11, 279, 6469, 9400, 28075, 20862, 449, 8254, 3953, 311, 24804, 13, 28275, 14662, 3919, 1611, 10746, 1101, 12580, 459, 77758, 8209, 311, 28008, 19922, 4409, 323, 18984, 9973, 1155, 279, 29315, 1288, 8493, 2500, 3280, 304, 43997, 13, 55764, 527, 1101, 15194, 279, 24113, 3157, 15499, 13, 1556, 2802, 304, 452, 1741, 426, 1171, 64, 753, 11258, 2201, 40593, 706, 1027, 74135, 2111, 1306, 279, 29315, 16654, 264, 15131, 6629, 29413, 2908, 11134, 11, 719, 11659, 53, 753, 49162, 74539, 68553, 10649, 426, 31141, 8115, 374, 2561, 389, 11542, 315, 5226, 13, 29140, 1101, 3802, 5657, 2025, 70971, 527, 10307, 83368, 452, 3251, 76, 20578, 753, 28501, 7029, 893, 14925, 73, 2473, 622, 22826, 65, 22506, 939, 13, 14013, 2630, 261, 61742, 45677, 11, 37318, 11, 706, 11096, 45721, 6469, 35120, 25188, 389, 264, 2380, 23086, 11941, 3568, 13, 55764, 690, 1390, 311, 14389, 279, 3600, 315, 389, 27578, 276, 29315, 4194, 54013, 9973, 1155, 320, 2414, 8, 369, 520, 3325, 2500, 3280, 13, 11659, 53, 74539, 4194, 57, 587, 10649, 426, 31141, 8115, 374, 2500, 2218, 369, 279, 65800, 34838, 323, 374, 2561, 389, 264, 1949, 8481, 13, 11205, 6783, 96331, 763, 713, 83132, 2641, 268, 32069, 279, 3351, 1306, 23524, 279, 9636, 12, 777, 6625, 439, 3451, 606, 315, 19627, 753, 12474, 35032, 323, 264, 1633, 13548, 2851, 24535, 763, 713, 83132, 2641, 268, 482, 889, 12570, 311, 55764, 13697, 14662, 3919, 1611, 10746, 323, 45067, 50002, 27268, 61965, 1603, 3339, 813, 3351, 11, 3779, 25, 3451, 43, 5038, 706, 6908, 4754, 323, 2225, 14662, 3919, 323, 50002, 6604, 1633, 7701, 922, 1461, 13, 3451, 1548, 374, 264, 3995, 11, 32855, 11, 2653, 64992, 8334, 449, 264, 3831, 690, 311, 3243, 323, 3217, 315, 5737, 304, 4156, 315, 220, 1399, 11, 931, 70402, 11, 779, 568, 8964, 1148, 279, 7410, 315, 31293, 374, 14639, 55764, 596, 220, 972, 4771, 6418, 45067, 61742, 45677, 706, 11096, 45721, 6469, 35120, 25188, 389, 264, 2380, 23086, 11941, 382, 19791, 25], prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

WWE legend The Rock, real name Dwayne Johnson, knows all about Liverpool having spent time there filming scenes for Fast and the Furious 6. And it appears the wrestler turned film star may have taken a likeness for the red side of Liverpool away with him as he returned to America. The Rock hinted who he supports by taking time out to pose alongside a 'You'll Never Walk Alone' artwork. The Rock clearly knows his stuff as he gives his followers a brief history on the famous song. Juan Mata pulls off his incredible scissor-kick against Liverpool as Manchester United won 2-1 at Anfield.

However, it is not known whether The Rock watched Sunday’s defeat to Manchester United, but if he did it would surely have left him feeling ‘rock bottom’.

An auction of a quaint, unrenovated Surry Hills home on Saturday reaped surprising bids, with the owner of the property managing to bag a whooping $1.5 million for the home, which didn\'t even have a bathroom and had holes in the ceiling. On the same day, a stunning beachfront home, owned by former TV comedian John \'Strop\' Cornell, in the stylish area of\xa0Belongil in Byron Bay was picked up by Harvey Norman heir Glen Norman for $10 million. Scroll down for video. 22 Ridge St, Surry Hills )pictured) sold for over $1.5 million on Saturday. So why are Australia\'s house prices so extortionate and can we expect more of this in the future? According to Director at LJ Hooker, Brigitte Blackman, low interest prices are pushing up real estate prices and mixed with a lack of stock on the market, things are only set to get worse. \'While we have cheap money, people will just extend themselves,\' Ms Blackman told Daily Mail Australia. \'Also there’s very low stock on the market, which I haven’t seen in a long time at this time of year. \'With low stock levels and lowest interest rates ever - which are projected to go down further - moneys cheap and real estates such a solid investment that people are spending big and wanting to buy, but there’s not much to buy,\' she said. The house had holes in the ceiling and didn\'t even have a kitchen. 14 registered buyers turned out for the auction and each battling it out to but the house. About 700 homes went under the hammer in Sydney on Saturday and Domain Group put the clearance rate at 86.1 per cent, the second highest result on record. Ms Blackman sold 22 Ridge St in Surry Hills on Saturday for $1.5 and said everyone was extremely surprised with the outcome, considering the reserve was set at $1.3 million. There were between 80-100 people at the auction and astonishingly 14 buyers registered to bid. The dilapidated four-bedroom Surry Hills terrace was unrenovated with no kitchen, no bathroom and not even a toilet. The home had been in the same family’s hands for more than 60 years, but was left in a state of neglect. Paint was peeling off the walls, holes littered the kitchen ceiling and\xa0and the garden was in some serious need of some tender loving care. The house didn\'t have a bathroom, a toilet or a kitchen but was located in prime real estate. Two other houses on the same street sold last year for less than this house, and they were both renovated. However, what it lacked in amenities it made up for in location and buyers scrambled over themselves to be the one to scoop up the hot property. \'Surry Hills is probably one of the hottest suburbs in Sydney that people want to buy,\' Ms Blackman said. \'It was what I call a rough diamond. It had the right orientation, it’s faced north at the rear. There are only a few streets in Surry Hills that do face north at the rear so that was a big plus and it was unrenovated but very solid, it wasn\'t falling down. \'It was raw, the potential was massive, it was a gem. Buyers saw that and we’re prepared to pay big dollars for it,\' she said. This Byron Bay property was snapped up by Harvey Norman heir Glen Norman. The stunning home is set right on the beach and is only accessible by a private path. Two properties on the same street went up for auction last year and both were renovated. One sold for $1.45 million and the other for $1.55 million. \'This one didn\'t even have a kitchen and barely a bathroom so it was a big surprise,\' Ms Blackman said. \'We\'ve got too much demand and low supply so unless the supply comes up it’s not going to meet the demand. I\'ve never heard buyers say to me: "There’s nothing else to see", generally they will say: "I\'ve got five other’s to see today" - \xa0and they’re not saying that right now. Mr Norman bought the home from his former father-in-law John\'strop\' Cornell. Glen Norman sold his Double Bay apartment for $4.5 million last week so he could move to Byron Bay. \'I think it’s a very interesting time, I\'ve been selling for 20 years and I can’t recall another time like this. Noones ever seen these low interest rates before because they\'ve never been this low in our country.\' Ms Blackman said she didn\'t know what was going to happen to the property market but she believes people are more interested in buying now, due to the high rent prices. \'Money’s cheap so people are buying,\' she said. \'If you were renting a property and you can afford to buy, why pay someone else’s rent when you can pay your own? That’s why there’s so many people in the market in my opinion.\' Further north in Byron Bay a stunning beachside home, formerly owned by comedian John \'Strop\' Cornell was snapped off the market by his former son-in-law Glen Norman. Interestingly, Mr Norman\'s move to Byron Bay\'s seaside replicates that of his ex-wife, who only returned to live there last year after selling her Bronte home for $4.6 million. Melissa Cornell and Glen Norman were married in 1997 at her father\'s Beach Hotel but separated in 2004. Norman had listed his  his three-bedroom apartment in Double Bay earlier this month and was hoping to secure $4 million for the north-facing home, which he bought in 2008. Last week, the Double Bay luxury apartment sold for $4.5 million.

Melissa Cornell and Glen Norman were married in 1997 at her father\'s Beach Hotel but separated in 2004. Melissa\'s father, well-known TV star John Cornell, quietly listed lot four and five at Belongil beach in last year. Melissa\'s father, well-known TV star John Cornell, quietly listed lot four and five at Belongil beach in last year. They also sold their other two lots of land overlooking the beach, one for $2 million to Melbourne restaurateur Shannon Bennett and the other for $2.25 million to Bennett\'s business partner Adam Garrisson. Real estate agent Glen Irwin from LJ Hooker told Daily Mail Australia that they were expecting such a high price for the house, considering the sale price of previous lots in the area.

Real estate agent Glen Irwin from LJ Hooker told Daily Mail Australia that they were expecting such a high price for the house, considering the sale price of previous lots in the area. \'There are five paths there and lot one sold for $2.25 million and lot three sold for $2 million,\' Mr Irwin said. \'There is no road in front of it and it can only be accessed by path. Its an exclusive enclave of Byron Bay.\' Mr Irwin also stated that there was a lot of interest in the property but Mr Norman proposed the highest bid. The sale is just short of the Byron Bay record set in 2006 at $15.68 million, which was set my Mr Irwin. The stunning home is as private as you can get and there is no main road at the front of the house. House prices in Byron Bay have always been high due to desirable location. The sale is just short of the Byron Bay record set in 2006 at $15.68 million, which was set my Mr Irwin. The stunning home features a verandah overlooking beautiful Belongil Beach. The three-bedroom home features large floor to ceiling glass doors, showcasing the sweeping beach views from every angle of the living and dining areas, and bedrooms. A self-contained studio downstairs opens on to manicured lawns and gardens. It also features stunning views of Cape Byron Light-house, Julian Rocks and Mt Warning. However, in a complete turnaround, a \'gingerbread house\' in Willoughby failed to sell under the hammer yesterday. The heritage-listed three-bedroom home at 105 Penshurst Street, which features enchanting gingerbread coloured bricks was left on the shelf, despite a lot of interest from buyers. \'It\'s a hell of a result,\' senior economist for the Domain Group, Andrew Wilson told Domain.

There were apparently 10 buyers registered to take part in the auction but unfortunately Auctioneer Mark Roberts had to work extremely hard to get even one bid from the crowd. \'This is an extraordinarily confident market we are seeing right now, people have accelerated their buying decisions,\' he said. There were apparently 10 buyers registered to take part in the auction but unfortunately Auctioneer Mark Roberts had to work extremely hard to get even one bid from the crowd. A sole bid of $1.4 million was issued but they then refused to negotiate on that figure. \'We had so much interest in this property… until today!\' Mr Roberts told the audience.

Please output the summary only, without any other text.\n\nArticle:\n(CNN)A new Justice Department report on Ferguson\'s police and courts could not be more clear: Change is needed. The 102-page report details widespread and systemic discrimination against blacks at the hands of officials -- painting probably the clearest picture yet of what the rule of law looks and feels like in the Missouri city. It includes 26 recommendations. The report is scathing in its critique, and clear about what needs to happen next, but it doesn\'t address the question: Who, if anyone, is responsible for what took place? Are individual officers to blame? Is the police chief? What about city officials who repeatedly pushed police to increase revenue through ticketing, resulting in disproportionate targeting of African-Americans? Writing for CNN, criminal defense attorney Mark O\'Mara argues in favor of gutting the entire police department, and starting from scratch. So far, one person has been fired; two more are on administrative leave. Are more heads likely to roll? "When the attorney general said that the Department of Justice has made certain recommendations, those aren\'t necessarily just recommendations. The Ferguson police department and municipal courts will have to reform. This is a must-do situation. We\'re talking about wholesale reform," said CNN legal analyst Sunny Hostin. "And I would be very surprised that any of the leadership remains." Mayor James Knowles said the two employees on leave are awaiting the results of an internal investigation. "Department of Justice officials informed the city of Ferguson that a review of city emails uncovered explicit racial bias by three individuals who are employed by the city of Ferguson police department. Let me be clear: This type of behavior will not be tolerated in the Ferguson police department or in any department in the city of Ferguson," he told reporters Wednesday. "The three individuals were placed on administrative leave pending an investigation. One has since been terminated." A source said the two employees "will not survive the investigation." CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin criticized the mayor\'s response, seemingly suggesting that more needed to be done in the wake of the Justice Department report. "You read this report, and, one officer loses his job? You know, you translate the bureaucratic gobbledygook of the mayor, that\'s all that happened there," he said. Surprisingly to some, controversial Police Chief Tom Jackson remains at the helm. So does Knowles. Although the report is limited to correcting action going forward, people affected by past abuses do have the option of filing civil lawsuits against specific individuals. Such cases are not easy to bring, according to Peter Joy, a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis. "In a court of law, the findings of this report wouldn\'t even be admissible," he said. "Basically, you\'d have to prove each allegation." Joy gave an example of person who paid a $100 fine that was unjustly levied. Finding lawyers who would take an individual case like that would be tough, he said, because there is no guarantee they could recover on behalf of their client, and the amount of damages could very widely. Practically, that person may be out of luck. But if the Justice Department gets its way, illegal or improper behavior on the part of police and courts in Ferguson could soon be a thing of the past. "It is time for Ferguson\'s leaders to take immediate, wholesale and structural corrective action," said Attorney General Eric Holder. "The United States Department of Justice reserves all of its rights and abilities to force compliance and to implement basic change. Nothing is off the table." CNN\'s Sara Sidner contributed to this report.\n\nSummary:', params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=128, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=False, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: [128000, 9370, 5730, 553, 279, 2768, 3754, 4652, 304, 220, 4386, 11460, 13, 5321, 2612, 279, 12399, 1193, 11, 2085, 904, 1023, 1495, 382, 17064, 512, 3100, 9944, 8, 32, 502, 12007, 6011, 1934, 389, 38476, 596, 4379, 323, 19359, 1436, 539, 387, 810, 2867, 25, 10604, 374, 4460, 13, 578, 220, 4278, 15463, 1934, 3649, 24716, 323, 46417, 21934, 2403, 40077, 520, 279, 6206, 315, 7510, 1198, 19354, 4762, 279, 11551, 15795, 6945, 3686, 315, 1148, 279, 6037, 315, 2383, 5992, 323, 11321, 1093, 304, 279, 25378, 3363, 13, 1102, 5764, 220, 1627, 19075, 13, 578, 1934, 374, 1156, 44661, 304, 1202, 43665, 11, 323, 2867, 922, 1148, 3966, 311, 3621, 1828, 11, 719, 433, 3250, 956, 2686, 279, 3488, 25, 10699, 11, 422, 5606, 11, 374, 8647, 369, 1148, 3952, 2035, 30, 8886, 3927, 9808, 311, 19065, 30, 2209, 279, 4379, 10388, 30, 3639, 922, 3363, 7510, 889, 19352, 15753, 4379, 311, 5376, 13254, 1555, 11989, 287, 11, 13239, 304, 80153, 25103, 315, 11904, 60164, 30, 24838, 369, 20352, 11, 9337, 9232, 14065, 4488, 507, 28703, 5169, 29633, 304, 4799, 315, 18340, 1303, 279, 4553, 4379, 9476, 11, 323, 6041, 505, 19307, 13, 2100, 3117, 11, 832, 1732, 706, 1027, 14219, 26, 1403, 810, 527, 389, 23541, 5387, 13, 8886, 810, 14971, 4461, 311, 6638, 30, 330, 4599, 279, 14065, 4689, 1071, 430, 279, 6011, 315, 12007, 706, 1903, 3738, 19075, 11, 1884, 7784, 956, 14647, 1120, 19075, 13, 578, 38476, 4379, 9476, 323, 27512, 19359, 690, 617, 311, 15180, 13, 1115, 374, 264, 2011, 30659, 6671, 13, 1226, 2351, 7556, 922, 35557, 15180, 1359, 1071, 20352, 5897, 18738, 56138, 16492, 258, 13, 330, 3112, 358, 1053, 387, 1633, 14792, 430, 904, 315, 279, 11692, 8625, 1210, 22868, 7957, 14521, 645, 1071, 279, 1403, 8420, 389, 5387, 527, 45088, 279, 3135, 315, 459, 5419, 8990, 13, 330, 27725, 315, 12007, 7510, 16369, 279, 3363, 315, 38476, 430, 264, 3477, 315, 3363, 14633, 43522, 11720, 19739, 15837, 555, 2380, 7931, 889, 527, 20011, 555, 279, 3363, 315, 38476, 4379, 9476, 13, 6914, 757, 387, 2867, 25, 1115, 955, 315, 7865, 690, 539, 387, 66441, 304, 279, 38476, 4379, 9476, 477, 304, 904, 9476, 304, 279, 3363, 315, 38476, 1359, 568, 3309, 19578, 8079, 13, 330, 791, 2380, 7931, 1051, 9277, 389, 23541, 5387, 15639, 459, 8990, 13, 3861, 706, 2533, 1027, 32372, 1210, 362, 2592, 1071, 279, 1403, 8420, 330, 14724, 539, 18167, 279, 8990, 1210, 20352, 10195, 5897, 18738, 42107, 2057, 677, 258, 32614, 279, 17352, 596, 2077, 11, 23490, 23377, 430, 810, 4460, 311, 387, 2884, 304, 279, 15508, 315, 279, 12007, 6011, 1934, 13, 330, 2675, 1373, 420, 1934, 11, 323, 11, 832, 9640, 33291, 813, 2683, 30, 1472, 1440, 11, 499, 15025, 279, 80495, 342, 92046, 49865, 1982, 315, 279, 17352, 11, 430, 596, 682, 430, 7077, 1070, 1359, 568, 1071, 13, 8242, 49264, 311, 1063, 11, 20733, 10289, 14681, 8529, 13972, 8625, 520, 279, 34865, 13, 2100, 1587, 14521, 645, 13, 10541, 279, 1934, 374, 7347, 311, 82475, 1957, 2133, 4741, 11, 1274, 11754, 555, 3347, 50162, 656, 617, 279, 3072, 315, 26559, 8431, 43986, 2403, 3230, 7931, 13, 15483, 5157, 527, 539, 4228, 311, 4546, 11, 4184, 311, 11291, 28237, 11, 264, 2383, 14561, 520, 6652, 3907, 304, 800, 13, 12140, 13, 330, 644, 264, 5590, 315, 2383, 11, 279, 14955, 315, 420, 1934, 8434, 956, 1524, 387, 1008, 45164, 1359, 568, 1071, 13, 330, 71903, 11, 499, 4265, 617, 311, 12391, 1855, 58494, 1210, 28237, 6688, 459, 3187, 315, 1732, 889, 7318, 264, 400, 1041, 7060, 430, 574, 52583, 398, 23464, 1142, 13, 43897, 21866, 889, 1053, 1935, 459, 3927, 1162, 1093, 430, 1053, 387, 11292, 11, 568, 1071, 11, 1606, 1070, 374, 912, 15803, 814, 1436, 11993, 389, 17981, 315, 872, 3016, 11, 323, 279, 3392, 315, 26186, 1436, 1633, 13882, 13, 18373, 2740, 11, 430, 1732, 1253, 387, 704, 315, 15369, 13, 2030, 422, 279, 12007, 6011, 5334, 1202, 1648, 11, 12079, 477, 41086, 7865, 389, 279, 961, 315, 4379, 323, 19359, 304, 38476, 1436, 5246, 387, 264, 3245, 315, 279, 3347, 13, 330, 2181, 374, 892, 369, 38476, 596, 6164, 311, 1935, 14247, 11, 35557, 323, 24693, 91852, 1957, 1359, 1071, 18919, 3331, 16645, 41433, 13, 330, 791, 3723, 4273, 6011, 315, 12007, 30600, 682, 315, 1202, 3268, 323, 18000, 311, 5457, 8907, 323, 311, 4305, 6913, 2349, 13, 12334, 374, 1022, 279, 2007, 1210, 20352, 596, 44020, 34989, 1215, 20162, 311, 420, 1934, 382, 19791, 25], prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

The infamous ‘sex-in-a-motel claim’ rumbled on for six years after the woman suffered cuts to her nose and mouth as well as ‘psychological injuries’. This all came about when a glass light fitting was pulled from the wall of the motel room as she had ‘vigorous’ sex with a local man in Nowra in November 2007. Public Service Minister Eric Abetz is making changes to the federal workplace insurer aimed at cracking down on ‘rorting and malingering\' Public Service Minister Eric Abetz revealed the cost of the claim as he engineered changes to the federal workplace insurer aimed at cracking down on ‘rorting and malingering’, by Commonwealth bureaucrats. The unidentified \'libidinous\' bureaucrat eventually lost her case in the High Court but left the Commonwealth with a legal bill topping $600,000, including the costs of the bureaucrat\'s own lawyers and barristers. ‘The flaws in the system were highlighted in lurid terms by the infamous "hotel room sex case", where a Commonwealth public servant successfully sought workers compensation for an injury sustained on a work trip, after hours, while engaging in sexual activity,’ the minister says in\xa0The Canberra Times. The unidentified \'libidinous\' bureaucrat eventually lost her case in the High Court but left the Commonwealth with a legal bill topping $600,000. ‘Thankfully the decision was ultimately overturned by the High Court, but at significant cost to the scheme, which had to pay more than $600,000 in legal costs to defend the spurious claim, including for the legal costs of the libidinous claimant.’ Legislation introduced to the Parliament on Wednesday can save federal government agencies up to $50 million in their insurance premiums each year by making sweeping reforms to the much-maligned public service compensation scheme. Senator Abetz said that, rather than paying them to stay at home, his reforms would help turn Comcare into an insurer that helped get injured public servants back to work.\n\nSummary:', params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=128, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=False, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: [128000, 9370, 5730, 553, 279, 2768, 3754, 4652, 304, 220, 4386, 11460, 13, 5321, 2612, 279, 12399, 1193, 11, 2085, 904, 1023, 1495, 382, 17064, 512, 32449, 79, 5184, 1047, 311, 89712, 709, 279, 400, 5067, 11, 931, 5897, 4121, 369, 264, 7487, 6, 20448, 3802, 555, 264, 586, 41564, 889, 574, 15902, 2391, 264, 81481, 1877, 10083, 79, 433, 574, 10675, 389, 8079, 13, 578, 39633, 3451, 11814, 3502, 7561, 1474, 41885, 3802, 529, 436, 26902, 389, 369, 4848, 1667, 1306, 279, 5333, 16654, 15455, 311, 1077, 19689, 323, 11013, 439, 1664, 439, 3451, 92109, 5848, 15319, 24535, 1115, 682, 3782, 922, 994, 264, 9168, 3177, 27442, 574, 13541, 505, 279, 7147, 315, 279, 81481, 3130, 439, 1364, 1047, 3451, 92347, 20857, 529, 1877, 449, 264, 2254, 893, 304, 4800, 969, 304, 6841, 220, 1049, 22, 13, 3142, 5475, 9675, 16645, 3765, 43289, 374, 3339, 4442, 311, 279, 6918, 27465, 73631, 20034, 520, 52829, 1523, 389, 3451, 81, 52572, 323, 296, 6260, 4776, 6, 3142, 5475, 9675, 16645, 3765, 43289, 10675, 279, 2853, 315, 279, 3802, 439, 568, 46036, 4442, 311, 279, 6918, 27465, 73631, 20034, 520, 52829, 1523, 389, 3451, 81, 52572, 323, 296, 6260, 4776, 20182, 555, 38298, 89740, 13, 578, 65578, 364, 2808, 307, 61798, 6, 34846, 18071, 9778, 5675, 1077, 1162, 304, 279, 5234, 7301, 719, 2163, 279, 38298, 449, 264, 5897, 4121, 61376, 400, 5067, 11, 931, 11, 2737, 279, 7194, 315, 279, 34846, 18071, 596, 1866, 21866, 323, 32039, 9487, 13, 3451, 791, 41859, 304, 279, 1887, 1051, 27463, 304, 47747, 307, 3878, 555, 279, 39633, 330, 39917, 3130, 1877, 1162, 498, 1405, 264, 38298, 586, 41564, 7946, 16495, 7487, 20448, 369, 459, 11134, 29759, 389, 264, 990, 8577, 11, 1306, 4207, 11, 1418, 23387, 304, 7392, 5820, 23189, 279, 13015, 2795, 304, 4194, 791, 69890, 8691, 13, 578, 65578, 364, 2808, 307, 61798, 6, 34846, 18071, 9778, 5675, 1077, 1162, 304, 279, 5234, 7301, 719, 2163, 279, 38298, 449, 264, 5897, 4121, 61376, 400, 5067, 11, 931, 13, 3451, 13359, 3725, 279, 5597, 574, 13967, 69098, 555, 279, 5234, 7301, 11, 719, 520, 5199, 2853, 311, 279, 13155, 11, 902, 1047, 311, 2343, 810, 1109, 400, 5067, 11, 931, 304, 5897, 7194, 311, 10726, 279, 993, 28626, 3802, 11, 2737, 369, 279, 5897, 7194, 315, 279, 3127, 307, 61798, 3802, 519, 14639, 73067, 11784, 311, 279, 20302, 389, 8079, 649, 3665, 6918, 3109, 13607, 709, 311, 400, 1135, 3610, 304, 872, 8276, 48607, 1855, 1060, 555, 3339, 42071, 31343, 311, 279, 1790, 1474, 48242, 586, 2532, 20448, 13155, 13, 23072, 3765, 43289, 1071, 430, 11, 4856, 1109, 12798, 1124, 311, 4822, 520, 2162, 11, 813, 31343, 1053, 1520, 2543, 1219, 10727, 1139, 459, 73631, 430, 9087, 636, 15902, 586, 42832, 1203, 311, 990, 382, 19791, 25], prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

Please output the summary only, without any other text.\n\nArticle:\nAn 11-year-old missed out on all the secondary schools she wanted and instead has been offered a place at an academy which was previously in special measures. Courtney Wells, of Birmingham, was one of thousands of children in England who were left disappointed after they missed out on their first choice secondary school place when they were notified yesterday. Her parents listed four schools in order of preference for their daughter but missed out on them all. Instead the 11-year-old, who is due to start year seven in September, has been offered a place at\xa0Bournville School and Sixth Form Centre. The school became an academy last November after it was placed in special measures in 2013 following a damning Ofsted report which rated it 'inadequate'. Courtney's mother Stacey Wells, 31, said: 'Courtney was really engaged in the whole process of deciding what school she wanted to go to. She went to look at all the schools. Courtney Wells, 11, missed out on all four of her choices for Birmingham secondary schools and was instead offered a place at an academy previously in special measures. Her mother Stacey is appealing the decision. 'We put a white board up in the kitchen and after each open evening she weighed up the pros and cons and gave the school a score out of ten. That's how she decided which schools she would choose. 'We are not wholly surprised that she didn't get into the university school as it looked so amazing that we were expecting it to be inundated with applicants. But we thought she would at least get one of her other choices. Birmingham was one of the worst areas where children missed out on their first choices as secondary school places were confirmed yesterday. A third of children in the city missed out on their first choice school compared to just two per cent in Cornwall. Councils notified parents of their children's fate yesterday by email or letter, meaning some families will not receive the news for several days. Courtney was rejected from her first choice University of Birmingham School (top left), which is being built, her second Shenley Academy (top right), which is closer to her home than the place she has. She was refused her third St Paul's School for Girls (bottom left) and her fourth, Colmers Senior School (bottom right) The 11-year-old applied for four schools - three of which were within 2.5 miles of her home but was rejected and given a place at Bournville School and Sixth Form Centre which was put into special measures in 2013. 'It is such a worrying time, all we want is the best for our daughter. We are going to appeal and fight this all the way.' The decision to offer Courtney a place at the academy came despite the site being further away from her home than her second choice school. She was also rejected from Colmers School in Rednal, despite having a foster sibling already at the school. Her parents have vowed to appeal the decision. They decided to put just four choices on the form instead of take advantage of listing six options because they thought this would be enough. They listed\xa0University of Birmingham School, Selly Oak; Shenley Academy, Northfield; St Paul's School for Girls, Edgbaston and Colmers School, Rednal, as their choices. Courtney was rejected from all four of her secondary school choices, despite her second preference being closer to her home and one of her choices being at a school where one of her foster siblings is a pupil. She has been offered a place at Bournville School and Sixth Form Centre, put in special measures in 2013. The couple's first choice for their daughter, currently a pupil at St Brigid's RC Primary School in Northfield, was the new University of Birmingham School, which is opening its doors for the first time in September. A spokeswoman for the school said it had received a staggering 1,100 applications for its 150 places, with 377 pupils putting it as their first choice. Courtney's parents have been told their daughter is currently in 177th place on the waiting list for a place at the sought-after free school, which is financially backed by the university and which has promised it will provide a private education standard without charging fees. The Year 7 intake will consist of 75 pupils living around its site in Bristol Road, Selly Oak, while another 75 will come from homes near Hall Green, Small Heath and the Jewellery Quarter railway stations. Peter Hay, Birmingham City Council's director of people, said: 'If you have applied for an academy, foundation, grammar, voluntary aided or free school and want to appeal against their decision, then you must contact that school directly for details of their appeal arrangements.' Under the admissions system, families list their school preferences and are then allocated places according to the schools’ admissions criteria. Many children living in big cities were left disappointed yesterday, and this graph shows the percentage of children who got their first choice secondary school when the places were announced on Monday. Factors can include proximity to the school, faith or ability – with some schools specifying how many bright, average and low ability pupils they will admit. A spokesman for the council said: 'The school admissions team has processed over 15,000 applications for secondary school places this year. Parents in Birmingham can submit up to six preferences, including grammar schools, and we always advise that parents are realistic when making their preferences. 'The advice from the local authority is that parents include at least one preference for a nearby school where their child would have got in under the distance criterion in the past. For the vast majority of families the reason they do not get the first preference is because other children better met the school's admission criteria than their child.' Yesterday more than half a million pupils were notified of their places and a number of appeals are expected.\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0,

Please output the summary only, without any other text.\n\nArticle:\nThe sight of John Terry lifting the Capital One Cup trophy aloft will spur Harry Kane on, although the Tottenham striker admitted that defeat on Sunday was 'the worst feeling in the world'. The 21-year-old striker was kept quiet by Chelsea at Wembley as Jose Mourinho won his first piece of silverware during a second stint in charge of the Blues. Terry opened the scoring before half-time and Kyle Walker put through his own net just before the break on an afternoon Tottenham were second best throughout. Harry Kane said losing the Capital One Cup final was 'the worst feeling in the world' The Tottenham striker wants the vision of John Terry lifting the trophy to spur him on in future. But, while Kane was down about the result, he believes Spurs have set themselves up for many more finals in the future. 'It's the worst feeling in the world losing, and losing in a final on the big stage even worse,' Kane told SpursTV. 'When you see Chelsea lift that trophy at the end it gives you that fire in your belly. 'It's disappointing - the lads gave it everything and I thought we played well. Kane down on his haunches as the Premier League leaders celebrate at the final whistle. 'In these big games you don't always get the luck you need and I felt Chelsea did with a couple of deflected goals which on another day wouldn't go in.' Mauricio Pochettino has taken huge credit for rapidly turning the fortunes around at White Hart Lane and told his players to be proud of their efforts. Asked what was said in the dressing room, Kane said: 'Just to be proud of ourselves. We've come a long way. It's a very young team with a new manager. 'To be in a final in the first season is great.'\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=128, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=False, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: [128000, 9370, 5730, 553, 279, 2768, 3754, 4652, 304, 220, 4386, 11460, 13, 5321, 2612, 279, 12399, 1193, 11, 2085, 904, 1023, 1495, 382, 17064, 512, 791, 14254, 315, 3842, 32618, 33510, 279, 18880, 3861, 11098, 38782, 54266, 728, 690, 60131, 14253, 46656, 389, 11, 8051, 279, 56648, 45041, 16584, 430, 18506, 389, 7418, 574, 364, 1820, 12047, 8430, 304, 279, 1917, 4527, 578, 220, 1691, 4771, 6418, 45041, 574, 8774, 11594, 555, 27616, 520, 468, 92729, 88, 439, 11097, 66418, 2834, 813, 1176, 6710, 315, 15310, 1698, 2391, 264, 2132, 61808, 304, 6900, 315, 279, 33425, 13, 32618, 9107, 279, 20413, 1603, 4376, 7394, 323, 31359, 23074, 2231, 1555, 813, 1866, 4272, 1120, 1603, 279, 1464, 389, 459, 13658, 56648, 1051, 2132, 1888, 6957, 13, 14253, 46656, 1071, 13490, 279, 18880, 3861, 11098, 1620, 574, 364, 1820, 12047, 8430, 304, 279, 1917, 6, 578, 56648, 45041, 6944, 279, 11376, 315, 3842, 32618, 33510, 279, 38782, 311, 60131, 1461, 389, 304, 3938, 13, 2030, 11, 1418, 46656, 574, 1523, 922, 279, 1121, 11, 568, 13919, 46142, 617, 743, 5694, 709, 369, 1690, 810, 41402, 304, 279, 3938, 13, 364, 2181, 596, 279, 12047, 8430, 304, 279, 1917, 13490, 11, 323, 13490, 304, 264, 1620, 389, 279, 2466, 6566, 1524, 11201, 2965, 46656, 3309, 46142, 16027, 13, 364, 4599, 499, 1518, 27616, 12157, 430, 38782, 520, 279, 842, 433, 6835, 499, 430, 4027, 304, 701, 36517, 13, 364, 2181, 596, 39223, 482, 279, 326, 7819, 6688, 433, 4395, 323, 358, 3463, 584, 6476, 1664, 13, 46656, 1523, 389, 813, 6520, 3265, 288, 439, 279, 20210, 9130, 6164, 18890, 520, 279, 1620, 40649, 13, 364, 644, 1521, 2466, 3953, 499, 1541, 956, 2744, 636, 279, 15369, 499, 1205, 323, 358, 6612, 27616, 1550, 449, 264, 5743, 315, 711, 2258, 9021, 902, 389, 2500, 1938, 8434, 956, 733, 304, 3238, 34492, 11518, 393, 5059, 7211, 3394, 706, 4529, 6908, 6807, 369, 19019, 13353, 279, 68603, 2212, 520, 5929, 23750, 27109, 323, 3309, 813, 4311, 311, 387, 12691, 315, 872, 9045, 13, 53763, 1148, 574, 1071, 304, 279, 32623, 3130, 11, 46656, 1071, 25, 364, 10156, 311, 387, 12691, 315, 13520, 13, 1226, 3077, 2586, 264, 1317, 1648, 13, 1102, 596, 264, 1633, 3995, 2128, 449, 264, 502, 6783, 13, 364, 1271, 387, 304, 264, 1620, 304, 279, 1176, 3280, 374, 2294, 22438, 19791, 25], prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

Claire Dean, 43, noticed an insect bite on her hip while gardening in September last year, but thought nothing of it. A few days later she began suffering mysterious flu-like symptoms, and  soon found herself in crippling pain. A few days later she woke up with numb cheeks and noticed her face was paralysed - to the point where she looked unrecognisable  in the mirror. She was in such agony she had to quit her job as a cleaner and  was hospitalised for two weeks. Claire Dean, 43, was left with a paralysed face and in agonising pain after being bitten by a tick while gardening in September last year. She is pictured with daughter Alexandra, 21. Ms Dean remembers being bitten on her hip but thought nothing of it. Days later, she suffered flu-like symptoms which became worse until she was in agony. After carrying out tests, doctors discovered the mother-of-two had developed\xa0Lyme disease,\xa0a\xa0bacterial infection spread to humans by infected ticks. She was prescribed antibiotics and underwent months of physiotherapy to help strengthen the muscles in her face - and is now telling her story to warn others of the dangers of tick bites. On the day she was bitten she had been wearing jeans and a baggy jumper, which she believes the tick must have become caught in. Ms Dean, from Castle Douglas, Scotland, said: 'I was in agony. The bites themselves weren't itchy or painful, so I didn't think they were the cause at first. 'I'm quite an active person and just put the aches and sharp pains down to my body being worn out.' She began suffering flu like symptoms and went to Dumfries and Galloway Royal Infirmary, when the pain in her hip and back became so severe she could hardly move. Lyme disease is a bacterial infection spread to humans by infected ticks. It is is the most common tick-borne infectious disease in the UK, Europe and North America. Public Health England estimates there are 2,000 to 3,000 cases of Lyme disease in England and Wales each year, and that about 15 per cent of cases occur while people are abroad. Ticks are tiny arachnids found in woodland areas that feed on the blood of mammals, including humans. Tick bites often go unnoticed and the tick can remain feeding for several days before dropping off. The longer the tick is in place, the higher the risk of it passing on the infection. Cases of Lyme disease have been reported throughout the UK, but areas known to have a particularly high population of ticks include Exmoor, the New Forest in Hampshire, the South Downs and parts of Wiltshire and Berkshire. They are also found in parts of Surrey and West Sussex, Thetford Forest in Norfolk, the Lake District, the North York Moors and the Scottish Highlands. Lyme disease can cause problems with a person's skin, joints, heart and nervous system. It is treated with antibiotics. Source: NHS Choices. She was treated for pressure sores with codeine and paracetemol, before being sent home with crutches. The pain became increasingly worse, but she didn't want to burden her family and so tried not to complain. She said: 'I tried to hide the pain from my kids as I didn't want to worry them, but it was getting harder to put on a brave face' 'I had to quit my job as a cleaner as I just couldn't work, I was in that much pain. 'It got so bad, my daughter called an out-of-hours doctor who visited me and gave me a morphine injection for the pain.' Just days later, Ms Dean woke to find she'd lost feeling in both of her cheeks. She could barely open her mouth to speak and found smiling or wrinkling her nose impossible. Her GP performed a series of reflex test and diagnosed Bell's Palsy – a rare condition that causes temporary weakness of the facial muscles. There is no known cure for the condition, although most people notice an improvement in their symptoms after a few weeks. But six months on, Ms Dean's face was showing few signs of improvement. 'I was horrified that my face was paralysed, but even more so when my doctor told me that there's no cure,' Ms Dean said. 'I was told I could be paralysed for weeks, or even months. Only time would tell.' Ms Dean, who is a single mother to Alexandra, 21, and Carl, 12, was referred to hospital. She underwent blood tests and a lumbar punctures, which is where a needle is inserted into the lower part of the spine to look for evidence of conditions affecting the brain, spinal cord or other parts of the nervous system. It was then revealed Ms Dean had been suffering from Lyme Disease - a bacterial infection spread to humans by infected ticks. When doctors gave the diagnosis, she suddenly remembered she had been bitten while gardening. Ms Dean, pictured before her face became paralysed, woke up one day with numb cheeks and no movement in her face. it was then she was diagnosed with Lyme disease. She said: 'It was only then that I remembered the bites on my hip. I showed them to the doctors and they confirmed they were tick bites. 'Bell's Palsy can be caused by a viral infection, so suddenly all of the symptoms I'd been suffering made sense.' Lyme disease is the most common tick-borne infectious disease in the UK, Europe and North America. The ticks, which flourish in long grass or undergrowth, typically attach to deer but can also be found on foxes, badgers, mice, birds as well as domestic pets - responsible for carrying the ticks into urban areas - and humans. Indeed, areas of undergrowth (and that includes parks and gardens as well as woodland and open country) are most likely to harbour ticks as they drop off their original hosts then climb to a point where they can latch on to other passing wildlife. Cases of Lyme disease have been reported throughout the UK, but there are certain areas which are know to be tick hotspots. These include Exmoor, the New Forest in Hampshire, the South Downs and parts of Wiltshire and Berkshire. Six months on, Ms Dean is starting to see some improvements, although she is still in pain. They are also found in parts of Surrey and West Sussex, Thetford Forest in Norfolk, the Lake District, the North York Moors and the Scottish Highlands. If left untreated, Lyme disease can spread causing arthritis, heart problems, muscle pain and neurological symptoms such as paralysis. Fortunately, Ms Dean was treated with antibiotics and spent the next two weeks in hospital recovering. But even after fighting the disease, her face still remains paralysed. She said: 'It was awful. I was finally feeling better after getting over the Lyme disease, but my face was still such a mess. I couldn't even bring myself to look in the mirror. 'Whenever I caught my reflection, it was like a stranger looking back at me. I had no facial expression. 'I suffered for months, until I finally started receiving physiotherapy to help speed up my recovery. 'I'm still not 100 per cent, but I'm getting there now. My face muscles are getting stronger and I'm slowly beginning to move them again. 'It's hard to believe that a few little tick bites caused so many problems. 'I hope my story encourages people to take more care in their back gardens. Who knows what's lurking in your flower bed.'\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0,

Please output the summary only, without any other text.\n\nArticle:\nAny TV fan worth their salt will be familiar with EastEnders' character Zoe Slater's dramatic wail: 'You ain't my mother!' And now the iconic 2001 scene where feisty character Kat Slater revealed that she was, in fact, Zoe's mother, has been named the greatest soap storyline of all time. In a poll of 2,000 soap fans, the scene - in which Kat's confession that Zoe was conceived after Kat was abused by her uncle Harry - topped the list of favourite tears, tantrums and cliffhangers. Scroll down for video. The Eastenders' storyline revealing Kat Slater to be the mother of her 'younger sister' Zoe has been named the greatest British soap narrative of all time. The iconic scene sees Zoe shout: 'You ain't my mother!' in the street before Kat screeches back: 'Yes I am!' The famous street row between the pair, where Zoe yells 'You ain't my mother' at Kat before finding out the truth even featured in Australian soap Neighbours' recent tribute video to celebrate EastEnders' 30th anniversary. Richard Hillman driving the Platt family into the canal in Coronation Street came second in the poll, followed by Hayley Cropper's courageous cancer battle and subsequent death in 2014. EastEnders bad guy Dirty Den getting shot in 1989 and the Coronation Street tram crash completed the top five. The episode was given the top spot in a poll of 2,000 soap fans on their favourite storylines. As well as old favourites, the recent Eastenders cliffhanger of 'who killed Lucy Beale' also made it in to the top ten, taking the number seven slot. A spokesman for survey site OnePoll.com, which commissioned the research, said that the winning storyline thoroughly deserved its title. 'The Kat and Zoe storyline is something most people are familiar with, even if they aren't an avid EastEnders fan. The tear-jerking episode of Coronation Street where Hayley Cropper died earned third place on the list. The recent EastEnders storyline 'Who Killed Lucy Beale' earned seventh place on the list after attracting millions of viewers in a week of live episodes to celebrate the soap's 30th anniversary. 'It had everything a great soap storyline needs - a blazing row, some tears and a huge shock just as the episode comes to a close.' He added that the reason that some of the older story lines had found their way into the top 50 was because they had a large impact on our lives. 'There have been many brilliant and gripping storylines over the years - whether they are tearjerkers like the moment Hayley died in Coronation Street or high drama like the live tram crash. 'Soaps are a huge part of our culture and these results show the storylines are remembered years after they are first screened.' In second place was Richard Hillman driving The Platts into a canal in a 2003 episode of Coronation Street. Sixth place in the poll went to the famous moment Dirty Den handed wife Angie divorce papers in the EastEnders' 1986 Christmas Day episode, followed by the London-based soap's huge 'Who Killed Lucy' story. After almost a year's worth of teases, the killer was finally revealed to be her half-brother Bobby during a week of live episodes during the EastEnders 30th anniversary celebration. Little Mo's domestic abuse storyline in EastEnders came eighth followed by Scott and Charlene's wedding in Neighbours and Deirdre Barlow being jailed for fraud in Coronation Street. Little Mo's domestic abuse story also stuck in viewers heads as the 2001 drama came eighth in the poll. Other storylines to feature in the top 20 include the whodunnit storyline 'Who Shot Phil' in EastEnders, after the hard-man was shot on his doorstep, Corrie's Tyrone suffering domestic abuse at the hands of partner Kirsty and Mike Baldwin dying in rival Ken Barlow's arms on the cobbles. The Emmerdale plane crash in 1993, the body under the patio in Brookside, Max and Stacey's affair in EastEnders and the famous love triangle between brothers Phil and Grant Mitchell and Grant's wife Sharon are also high on the list. More than half of the storylines featured in the poll were ones from EastEnders, including the long-running storyline of 'Who Shot Phil Mitchell' that was on our screens over 2000-2001 coming 11th in the poll. EastEnders features heavily in the top 50 with more than half the list made up of storylines from the soap. Old favourites such as Michelle Fowler falling pregnant with Dirty Den's baby as a teenager and Nick Cotton trying to kill mum Dot all feature alongside more recent storylines such as Dean Watt's attack on Linda. Brookside, which was last on our screens in 2003, also features several times with Nat and Georgia's incest and Beth and Margaret's lesbian kiss, which was seen as a ground-breaking storyline at the time it was aired. 1.

Please output the summary only, without any other text.\n\nArticle:\nAn ex-CFO and Chick-fil-A protestor who lost his job after posting a video rant against one of the chain\'s employees  has since lost his home and lives on food stamps. Adam Mark Smith, 37, who worked for an Arizona-based medical device manufacturer, was shamed after the 2012 YouTube video was posted showing him berating employee Rachel Elizabeth. The video which expressed his disdain over the firm\'s anti-gay marriage stance went viral, and left him unemployed and forced to lose his home. Nearly three years later, the married father of four is still searching for a job and his family previously had to give away possessions before he was hired and fired again, according to\xa0ABC. Scroll down for video. Adam Smith was the former CFO of an Arizona-based medical device manufacturer, before he was fired after posting a video of himself berating a Chick-fil-A employee for the fast-food chain\'s anti-gay marriage stance. Three years later from the viral video that shook his life from riches to rags, the married father of four is still searching for a job (Smith above with his family) At the time he was working as CFO for Vante, Smith was earning $200,000 annually and had more than $1million in stock options, but he said it was all taken from him when he was fired. His 2012 firing was reported on the same day as the counter-protest against Chick-fil-A\'s Appreciation Day as thousands of gay couples flocked to restaurants to kiss during the summer of 2012. Things were looking rough for Smith and his wife, Amy, along with their four sons after they lost their home and moved into an RV. But there was silver lining for him and the chance for a new start when he was offered a new job as a CFO in Portland a few months later. \'I felt like, "yeah, I got it. I am back\'\',\' he said. However, nearly two weeks later, he was fired once again after his boss realized he was the man from the video. In the 2012 video that went viral, he told Chick-fil-A employee Rachel Elizabeth while at the drive-thru window that he did not know how she lived with herself and worked there. Smith posted a follow-up video apologizing to Elizabeth (above) which she accepted. As the incident continues to haunt him, he said he does not regret the stand he took but he regrets the way he spoke to Elizabeth. While Smith is unsure if the incident will ever go away, he has turned to meditation, and has written a memoir, A Million Dollar Cup of Water:\xa0Discovering the Wealth in Authenticity. The controversy surrounding one of America\'s biggest fast-food chains began in 2012 after a series of anti-same sex marriage statements from Chick-fil-A\'s COO Dan T. Cathy. Local media had previously reported that the company, founded in 1946 by Cathy’s father, S. Truett Cathy, sponsored several organisations and group which actively oppose LGBT rights and same-sex marriage. Chick-fil-A donated more than $3million between 2003 and 2009 to Christian organizations with a well-known anti-gay agenda, and in 2010 alone Chick-fil-A gave nearly $2million to such causes, according to reports. In June and July 2012, Dan Cathy made several statements against gay marriage. When asked about Chick-fil-A’s backing of ‘traditional’ families with a husband and wife, Cathy responded \'Well, guilty as charged’. He also stated that\xa0Chick-fil-A is runs on \'traditional Christian values\' and is\'very much supportive of the family — the biblical definition of the family unit\'. In response, gay rights protesters launched nationwide boycotts and staged same-sex \'kiss-ins\' at Chick-fil-A stores across the country. The book tells of how his backlash from the public took him from riches to rags, to \'true wealth\'. In job interviews Smith is honest about the video, he said, but he thinks employers are scared to hire him because they think it could possibly reoccur again. In the original video posted three years ago, Smith waits in line for a free promotional water at a Chick-fil-A before expressing his disdain for the firm\'s support for traditional Christian marriage. Filmed by Smith on his own phone, the former CFO gets to the window of the drive-thru and starts to all-out bully the young female employee behind the counter, who remains calm and polite throughout the whole exchange. He said: \'I don\'t know how you live with yourself and work here. I don\'t understand it. This is a horrible corporation with horrible values.\' Elizabeth tells him repeatedly to have a nice day and that it is a pleasure to serve him as well as saying: \'I\'m staying neutral on this subject. My personal beliefs don\'t belong in the workplace.\' As he drives off he tells the worker: \'I\'m a nice guy by the way, and I\'m totally heterosexual. Just can\'t stand the hate. It\'s gotta stop guys, stand up.\' Once he posted the video and went back to work, he said his employees were shocked. Smith told 20/20: \'I got into work and the receptionist, the first thing, big eyes, \'Adam, what did you do?\', she said. \'The voicemail is completely full, and it\'s full of bomb threats.\'\' After the video went viral, according to a MarketWire statement, Smith was fired from his job at Vante, Inc. They released a statement saying: \'The actions of Mr Smith do not reflect our corporate values in any manner. Vante is an equal opportunity company with a diverse workforce, which holds diverse opinions. In his apology video, Smith told Elizabeth he was sorry for the way he spoke to her and that she handled the situation with dignity and grace. Wanda Flory, of Swanton, Ohio, center, watches with Terry, (left), and her husband Richard, (center right), as Thea Grabiec, (right), kisses Sarah Shovan during the counter-protest against Chick-fil-A\'s Appreciation Day. Smith also told Elizabeth in his apology video that he was angry by the number of people who were supporting Chick-fil-A during the Appreciation Day and became unraveled. \'We respect the right of our employees and all Americans to hold and express their personal opinions, however, we also expect our company officers to behave in a manner commensurate with their position and in a respectful fashion that conveys these values of civility with others.\' After losing his job at Vante, Smith removed his original video from YouTube and posted an eight-minute video apology to Elizabeth. \'I am so very sorry for the way I spoke to you,\' said Smith in the video. \'You handled my frustrating rant with such dignity and composure. \'Every time I watch the video I am blown away by really the beauty in what you did, and your kindness, and your patience with me.\' Smith explained that he was enraged by the number of people that had come out to support the chicken fast-food firm during last weeks \'Chick-fil-A\'s Appreciation Day\' and lost his cool. Shown Smith\'s apology by an anchor on Fox News at the time, Elizabeth accepted it. She said: \'I do forgive him. I think he realizes how bad it was to make that tape. \'I feel sorry for him and his family, and for everything that has happened to him since.\'\n\nSummary:', params: SamplingParams(n=1,

Fellaini was a 20-year-old with Standard Liege when his outstanding display against Steven Gerrard in a 2008 Champions League qualifier persuaded Everton to buy him 19 days later for a club record £15million. He became a cult hero at Goodison Park for the next five years before signing for Manchester United in 2013. Now in his second season at Old Trafford and used mainly as a striker by Louis van Gaal, he is in the best form of his United career and scored and made an assist in last weekend's 3-0 victory against Tottenham. Marouane Fellaini fired Manchester United into the lead against Tottenham with a smart finish. The Belgian trains ahead of United's crucial clash with Liverpool on Sunday, where he is sure to be involved. Fellaini has grown from a bit-part player last season to become a vital member of Louis van Gaal's squad. Steve Round, assistant-manager to David Moyes at Everton and Manchester United and who worked with Fellaini at both clubs, recounts how it all began. 'Marouane had been on Everton's radar for a while. His ability to play in different positions was attractive because the club didn't have the money to pay big fees on several players,' explains Round. 'David asked me to go and watch him play Liverpool at Anfield and he was very impressive. A lot of players would have been dominated in midfield by someone like Steven Gerrard in his own stadium but Marouane competed and gave as good as he got. He wasn't overawed and you could see he had ability. 'When David asked my opinion, it was positive and the club signed him in what was a big deal for them given their finances at the time.' Former Everton assistant Steve Round watched Fellaini play against Liverpool for former club Standard Liege. Round gave the midfielder a glowing reference to David Moyes who sanctioned a £15m deal to sign him. Fellaini became one of the most instantly-recognisable figures in the English game with his huge hair making him appear even bigger than his 6ft4ins frame. He became a fearsome threat in the air though opponents often felt he was too aggressive with his elbows and it has to be pointed out the Belgian has received 56 yellow cards and two reds since he moved to England. Having worked closely with Fellaini, Round says there is far more to his game than the 27-year-old is given credit for. 'He is technically very good, he may not have the same range of passing as Gerrard but he rarely gives the ball away. And his chest control is as good as anyone I've seen in the game. He can play three positions well; holding midfield, number 10 or up top, where we used him with Tim Cahill in the season we reached the FA Cup final. I think he is best in a more advanced position where he has more freedom and not as much defensive responsibilities. Round (left) was assistant to Moyes at Everton and then Manchester United. Fellaini became a cult hero at Goodison Park, where he spent five seasons. 'Marouane can hold the ball up and bring others into play and I can see why Wayne Rooney enjoyed playing with him, in a similar way that Michael Owen benefitted from Emile Heskey's physical presence for England.' A protracted transfer from Everton to United was finally completed in the summer of 2013 for £27million after Moyes and Round had been appointed at Old Trafford to begin the post-Sir Alex Ferguson era. 'I remember Ryan Giggs warning us that Manchester United can take some getting used to for new signings. He sited the example of Patrice Evra who turned out to be a great player for the club. Ryan said he was taken off after 45 minutes of his debut against Manchester City because it was such a culture shock. 'Marouane is a humorous guy, always able to take fun out of himself. I like him. But I guess being the only signing of that transfer window brought its own pressure and looking back maybe he was a bit quieter at the beginning than he was at Everton. But that's also natural when you are joining a new club with players who have been successful.' Fellaini followed Moyes to Manchester United, but was considered a figure of fun after the disappointing season under the former Everton boss. Fellaini starred in the 3-0 win over Liverpool at Old Trafford in December, and offers Van Gaal an alternative. After a nightmare first season in which United finisehd seventh, Moyes was sacked and Round left too. Fellaini stayed but was regarded at that time as a figure of fun. Round is not surprised he has been able to turn his fortunes around. 'I always thought he would show people what he could do at United. It's like Ryan said, it can take a few months for a new signing to be comfortable. He has always worked hard in training, he doesn't hide when things aren't going well. That has helped him. 'It's hard to say what will happen at United next. The pressure is always on to win matches and you don't know what the manager will do in the summer. But Marouane has shown this season he is an asset to Manchester United.' And at lunchtime on Sunday, he will hope to show that at Anfield, the ground where it all started for him. The only thing he'd like to change is the result – seven years ago, Liverpool edged Liege 1-0 with an injury-time winner from Dirk Kuyt.\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0,

The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) was already examining allegations against ten officers involved in the investigation into one of the country's most prolific child abuse rings. But today the commission said it had received 30 new complaints containing 100 allegations about 42 officers involved in the Rotherham investigation. The Independent Police Complaints Commission is examining 100 allegations made against 42 officers from South Yorkshire Police who investigated child sex abuse in Rotherham (file image) The complaints came in the wake of the Jay Report, which described how 1,400 children, mainly girls, were routinely raped, trafficked and groomed in South Yorkshire between 1997 and 2013. It said in a statement: 'The complaints contain more than 100 allegations against 42 named police officers, both retired and serving, as well as a number of allegations against officers whose identities are currently unknown.' The complaints followed on from the Jay Report, which described how at least 1,400 children were raped, trafficked and groomed in the South Yorkshire town between 1997 and 2013. The IPCC statement said: 'Work to establish the identity of the unknown officers and to identify any links between the different complaints and incidents is ongoing. 'The allegations range from neglect of duty by failing to adequately investigate on the basis of intelligence or to deal with incidents appropriately, inappropriate comments and suggestions of corrupt relationships between police officers and offenders.' The commission said it was also investigating an allegation that South Yorkshire Police failed to act on information passed to them in 2004 and 2006 about alleged child abuse in nearby Sheffield. This complaint relates to two named police officers who are now retired from the police service, the IPCC said. The Jay Report, published in August last year, sparked furious debate about the tragic crimes which took place in Rotherham, and how the perpetrators went unchallenged for so long. The Jay report found that the abuse went unchallenged as police and council chiefs were afraid of being labelled racist, as the perpetrators were largely gangs of Asian men. Professor Alexis Jay, who wrote the report, described how hundreds of vulnerable teenagers, mainly girls, were routinely exploited by gangs of mainly Asian men with impunity. Police and senior council officers were accused of failing to tackle the problem for fear of being seen as racist, and of ignoring or doubting the victim's accounts. A wave of high profile resignations followed and the National Crime Agency was brought in to investigate the crimes and how they were handled. The Jay Report was followed by another report by Louise Casey, which was scathing in its criticism of Rotherham Council and led to the replacement of the local authority's ruling cabinet with commissioners appointed by Communities Secretary Eric Pickles.

The Czechs, however, can reclaim outright first place by beating Latvia later in the day. Bolton Wanderers forward Gudjohnsen, back in the side for the first time since going back on his November 2013 decision to retire from international football, gave Iceland the lead in the 20th minute.

The former Barcelona and Chelsea marksman received a pass from Johann Gudmundsson and the 36-year-old slid the ball into the corner of the net to notch his 25th goal for his country and his first since 2009. Bjarnason headed the second from a cross by Swansea City's Gylfi Sigurdsson 12 minutes later and the same player then completed the scoring in stoppage time when his shot went in after taking a big deflection. Iceland now have 12 points from five games while Kazakhstan are rooted to the bottom of the group with one.

Officers met "complete chaos" when they tried to find out what happened not long after midnight Friday, Sheriff Frank McKeithen told CNN affiliate WMBB when interviewed on the scene. Video showed the streets teeming with young people. Three people with gunshot wounds were found inside a house, one outside the house, one in the median of the road and two on the other side of the road, the sheriff\'s office said in a press release. "We have about 100 witnesses or so that we are trying to separate and interview," McKeithen told WMBB.  "We have a mess." The scene was so mixed up that deputies from five adjacent counties and officers from the Florida Highway Patrol and Panama City Beach police were called in to assist. The shooting occurred at a residence on Thomas Drive, the main drag in the beach town. Several of the victims were students from Alabama A&M University who were visiting town for spring break, the sheriff\'s office said. They\'re between 20 and 22 years of age. During February and March, up to six million young people visit Panama City Beach, which some have been dubbed "the Spring Break Capital of the World." The Panhandle town has a resident population of about 12,000. Some of the young people were shot multiple times. They were taken to area hospitals, where three were listed in critical condition and three in stable condition, the sheriff\'s office said. The seventh person was in surgery when the press release was issued and no update on his condition was provided. Authorities arrested David Jarmichael Daniels, 22, of Mobile, Alabama, on seven counts of attempted murder. A.40-caliber pistol was found in the backyard of a residence. Officials did not mention a possible motive. The shooting was one of six firearms-related incidents of the night, with four guns seized in drug cases, the sheriff\'s office said in a press release. Other details were not provided. On Saturday night, the Panama City Beach City Council held a special meeting to talk about the violence. "It\'s time to stop the bloodshed," said council member Keith Curry, according to WMBB. "We\'re lucky that we don\'t have seven dead people." "This is a hostile takeover, an attempt at a hostile takeover," said Sparky Sparkman, owner of Spinnaker Beach Club. "And if anyone here doesn\'t think what\'s going on out there is hostile, just ride up and down the street." The council considered banning alcohol on the beach through mid-April, but that measure was voted down, WMBB said. The council approved more funding for extra enforcement on the beach.\n\nSummary:', params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=128, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=False, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: [128000, 9370, 5730, 553, 279, 2768, 3754, 4652, 304, 220, 4386, 11460, 13, 5321, 2612, 279, 12399, 1193, 11, 2085, 904, 1023, 1495, 382, 17064, 512, 3100, 9944, 8, 60628, 7926, 44041, 1274, 11, 1063, 889, 3782, 311, 49136, 4409, 13011, 11, 9784, 11, 369, 10683, 1464, 11, 1051, 28593, 304, 264, 3389, 45427, 10658, 11, 279, 9332, 6406, 29783, 596, 8410, 1071, 304, 264, 3577, 4984, 13, 49947, 2322, 330, 15079, 28013, 1, 994, 814, 6818, 311, 1505, 704, 1148, 7077, 539, 1317, 1306, 33433, 6740, 11, 29783, 9454, 4584, 91428, 268, 3309, 20352, 22325, 468, 8578, 33, 994, 30147, 389, 279, 6237, 13, 8519, 8710, 279, 14708, 1028, 74914, 449, 3995, 1274, 13, 14853, 1274, 449, 74881, 34254, 1051, 1766, 4871, 264, 3838, 11, 832, 4994, 279, 3838, 11, 832, 304, 279, 23369, 315, 279, 5754, 323, 1403, 389, 279, 1023, 3185, 315, 279, 5754, 11, 279, 40839, 596, 5274, 1071, 304, 264, 3577, 4984, 13, 330, 1687, 617, 922, 220, 1041, 28823, 477, 779, 430, 584, 527, 4560, 311, 8821, 323, 7274, 1359, 4584, 91428, 268, 3309, 468, 8578, 33, 13, 220, 330, 1687, 617, 264, 9622, 1210, 578, 6237, 574, 779, 9709, 709, 430, 53928, 505, 4330, 24894, 31276, 323, 9808, 505, 279, 9784, 29866, 45498, 323, 49136, 4409, 13011, 4379, 1051, 2663, 304, 311, 7945, 13, 578, 10658, 10222, 520, 264, 22423, 389, 11355, 16542, 11, 279, 1925, 11161, 304, 279, 11573, 6424, 13, 26778, 315, 279, 12697, 1051, 4236, 505, 21272, 362, 40316, 3907, 889, 1051, 17136, 6424, 369, 10683, 1464, 11, 279, 40839, 596, 5274, 1071, 13, 2435, 2351, 1990, 220, 508, 323, 220, 1313, 1667, 315, 4325, 13, 12220, 7552, 323, 5587, 11, 709, 311, 4848, 3610, 3995, 1274, 4034, 49136, 4409, 13011, 11, 902, 1063, 617, 1027, 42160, 330, 1820, 12531, 15996, 18880, 315, 279, 4435, 1210, 578, 11233, 8355, 6424, 706, 264, 19504, 7187, 315, 922, 220, 717, 11, 931, 13, 4427, 315, 279, 3995, 1274, 1051, 6689, 5361, 3115, 13, 2435, 1051, 4529, 311, 3158, 24461, 11, 1405, 2380, 1051, 10212, 304, 9200, 3044, 323, 2380, 304, 15528, 3044, 11, 279, 40839, 596, 5274, 1071, 13, 578, 31487, 1732, 574, 304, 15173, 994, 279, 3577, 4984, 574, 11136, 323, 912, 2713, 389, 813, 3044, 574, 3984, 13, 68415, 12800, 6941, 622, 2227, 60808, 50635, 11, 220, 1313, 11, 315, 13716, 11, 21272, 11, 389, 8254, 14921, 315, 17644, 10102, 13, 362, 13, 1272, 49236, 8799, 40536, 574, 1766, 304, 279, 36760, 315, 264, 22423, 13, 64239, 1550, 539, 6420, 264, 3284, 47094, 13, 578, 10658, 574, 832, 315, 4848, 32653, 14228, 24455, 315, 279, 3814, 11, 449, 3116, 16766, 31589, 304, 5623, 5157, 11, 279, 40839, 596, 5274, 1071, 304, 264, 3577, 4984, 13, 7089, 3649, 1051, 539, 3984, 13, 1952, 7884, 3814, 11, 279, 49136, 4409, 13011, 4409, 9251, 5762, 264, 3361, 6574, 311, 3137, 922, 279, 9349, 13, 330, 2181, 596, 892, 311, 3009, 279, 6680, 70561, 1359, 1071, 15177, 4562, 32602, 47075, 11, 4184, 311, 468, 8578, 33, 13, 330, 1687, 2351, 18069, 430, 584, 1541, 956, 617, 8254, 5710, 1274, 1210, 330, 2028, 374, 264, 33615, 64310, 11, 459, 4879, 520, 264, 33615, 64310, 1359, 1071, 27565, 88, 27565, 1543, 11, 6506, 315, 3165, 6258, 4506, 13011, 10349, 13, 330, 3112, 422, 5606, 1618, 3250, 956, 1781, 1148, 596, 2133, 389, 704, 1070, 374, 33615, 11, 1120, 12141, 709, 323, 1523, 279, 8761, 1210, 578, 15177, 6646, 49636, 13200, 389, 279, 11573, 1555, 5209, 67248, 321, 11, 719, 430, 6767, 574, 16626, 1523, 11, 468, 8578, 33, 1071, 13, 578, 15177, 12054, 810, 11006, 369, 5066, 13627, 389, 279, 11573, 382, 19791, 25], prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

Saad al-Jamal purchased the two-month-old lion cubs from the cash-strapped Rafah zoo. He has plans to raise them at his house in the Al-Shabora refugee camp in Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip, although he faces a difficult task as the lions - and their appetites - grow. Saad al-Jamal holds the lions in his arms as one of them struggles in an effort to get back on the ground. Mr al-Jamal\xa0plans to raise the cubs at his house in the Al-Shabora refugee camp in the southern Gaza Strip. He refused to say how much he paid for the cubs, but admitted to AFP that he has received a $9,000 offer (£6,000) to buy them. The two lion cubs, one male and one female, have been named Alex and Mona. They have been living in the three-bedroom flat ‘like members of the family’ for 10 weeks, and they play 'all day long' with Mr al-Jamal's children and grandchildren. Footage shows the cubs play-fighting on the floor of the family's flat, and interacting with young children. The lion cubs can be seen on the video interacting with Mr al-Jamal’s children and grandchildren. Bringing the cubs outside, Mr al-Jamal holds the lions in his arms and as of them fights against him to be put back down. Other clips show the owner is featured stroking them as they bask in the sun. It is believed that the parents of the cubs were brought into Gaza via a tunnel along the border with Egypt around three years ago. Raising two lion cubs is a costly venture, and Mr al-Jamal has plans to use them to earn money. He intends to lease them to parks, restaurants and seaside resorts once they are a few months older. Saad Al-Jamal purchased the two-month-old lion cubs called Alex and Mona from the Rafah zoo. Once the cubs are 15-months-old they will develop adult teeth and possess the ability to tear flesh. At just two months, the cubs eat half a kilogram of meat a day, and their appetites will become even larger as they get older. Right now the animals are at an age where they are unable to inflict any real damage. But once the cubs reach 15-months-old they will develop adult teeth and will possess the ability to tear flesh. At which point, Mr al-Jamal’s living situation might not be so harmonious.\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=128, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=False, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: [128000, 9370, 5730, 553, 279, 2768, 3754, 4652, 304, 220, 4386, 11460, 13, 5321, 2612, 279, 12399, 1193, 11, 2085, 904, 1023, 1495, 382, 17064, 512, 32, 22596, 34267, 17427, 813, 19569, 45715, 311, 832, 1938, 1866, 264, 40132, 994, 568, 18306, 1403, 315, 1124, 323, 7263, 1124, 1139, 813, 2162, 13, 16233, 329, 453, 12278, 309, 278, 15075, 279, 1403, 23086, 6418, 40132, 272, 16115, 505, 279, 8515, 42728, 5795, 40677, 1494, 42014, 13, 1283, 706, 6787, 311, 4933, 1124, 520, 813, 3838, 304, 279, 1708, 31361, 4422, 64, 34267, 3190, 304, 40677, 1494, 304, 279, 18561, 29762, 35999, 11, 8051, 568, 12580, 264, 5107, 3465, 439, 279, 69132, 482, 323, 872, 30168, 3695, 482, 3139, 13, 16233, 329, 453, 12278, 309, 278, 10187, 279, 69132, 304, 813, 11977, 439, 832, 315, 1124, 28970, 304, 459, 5149, 311, 636, 1203, 389, 279, 5015, 13, 4491, 453, 12278, 309, 278, 4194, 79624, 311, 4933, 279, 272, 16115, 520, 813, 3838, 304, 279, 1708, 31361, 4422, 64, 34267, 3190, 304, 279, 18561, 29762, 35999, 13, 1283, 16436, 311, 2019, 1268, 1790, 568, 7318, 369, 279, 272, 16115, 11, 719, 16584, 311, 27746, 430, 568, 706, 4036, 264, 400, 24, 11, 931, 3085, 54915, 21, 11, 931, 8, 311, 3780, 1124, 13, 578, 1403, 40132, 272, 16115, 11, 832, 8762, 323, 832, 8954, 11, 617, 1027, 7086, 8683, 323, 99883, 13, 2435, 617, 1027, 5496, 304, 279, 2380, 67967, 10269, 3451, 4908, 3697, 315, 279, 3070, 529, 369, 220, 605, 5672, 11, 323, 814, 1514, 364, 543, 1938, 1317, 6, 449, 4491, 453, 12278, 309, 278, 596, 2911, 323, 50851, 13, 15819, 425, 5039, 279, 272, 16115, 1514, 2269, 45850, 389, 279, 6558, 315, 279, 3070, 596, 10269, 11, 323, 45830, 449, 3995, 2911, 13, 578, 40132, 272, 16115, 649, 387, 3970, 389, 279, 2835, 45830, 449, 4491, 453, 12278, 309, 278, 753, 2911, 323, 50851, 13, 98173, 279, 272, 16115, 4994, 11, 4491, 453, 12278, 309, 278, 10187, 279, 69132, 304, 813, 11977, 323, 439, 315, 1124, 28533, 2403, 1461, 311, 387, 2231, 1203, 1523, 13, 7089, 27203, 1501, 279, 6506, 374, 15109, 31511, 10789, 1124, 439, 814, 293, 1091, 304, 279, 7160, 13, 1102, 374, 11846, 430, 279, 6699, 315, 279, 272, 16115, 1051, 7263, 1139, 29762, 4669, 264, 26711, 3235, 279, 3973, 449, 15212, 2212, 2380, 1667, 4227, 13, 432, 51226, 1403, 40132, 272, 16115, 374, 264, 34348, 26255, 11, 323, 4491, 453, 12278, 309, 278, 706, 6787, 311, 1005, 1124, 311, 7380, 3300, 13, 1283, 44330, 311, 26120, 1124, 311, 27943, 11, 15926, 323, 93876, 61545, 3131, 814, 527, 264, 2478, 4038, 9191, 13, 16233, 329, 1708, 12278, 309, 278, 15075, 279, 1403, 23086, 6418, 40132, 272, 16115, 2663, 8683, 323, 99883, 505, 279, 40677, 1494, 42014, 13, 9843, 279, 272, 16115, 527, 220, 868, 23086, 82, 6418, 814, 690, 2274, 6822, 18311, 323, 15575, 279, 5845, 311, 18036, 26000, 13, 2468, 1120, 1403, 4038, 11, 279, 272, 16115, 8343, 4376, 264, 15395, 13255, 315, 13339, 264, 1938, 11, 323, 872, 30168, 3695, 690, 3719, 1524, 8294, 439, 814, 636, 9191, 13, 10291, 1457, 279, 10099, 527, 520, 459, 4325, 1405, 814, 527, 12153, 311, 68568, 904, 1972, 5674, 13, 2030, 3131, 279, 272, 16115, 5662, 220, 868, 23086, 82, 6418, 814, 690, 2274, 6822, 18311, 323, 690, 15575, 279, 5845, 311, 18036, 26000, 13, 2468, 902, 1486, 11, 4491, 453, 12278, 309, 278, 753, 5496, 6671, 2643, 539, 387, 779, 18249, 1245, 382, 19791, 25], prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

Pacquiao acquired the 10,000 square-foot, seven-bedroom property in an exclusive community in California just over a month away from his showdown with the unbeaten American. As well as the offer of US$12.5m, it was four tickets to one of the biggest fights in boxing history at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas on May 2 that struck him the deal. 'No doubt it helped,' Pacquiao's estate agent Elsa Nelson told USA Today Sports. 'The sellers are great fans of boxing and of Manny, so it was a big deal.' Manny Pacquiao has paid $12.5million for a luxurious mansion in Beverly Hills, California. The Filipino boxer acquired the property just over a month out from his fight against Floyd Mayweather. Pacquiao also threw in four tickets to his fight against Mayweather at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas on May 2.\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=128, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=False, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: [128000, 9370, 5730, 553, 279, 2768, 3754, 4652, 304, 220, 4386, 11460, 13, 5321, 2612, 279, 12399, 1193, 11, 2085, 904, 1023, 1495, 382, 17064, 512, 44, 13184, 12925, 447, 23332, 706, 5115, 16280, 1027, 36567, 709, 813, 47979, 369, 279, 400, 3101, 59413, 4465, 449, 46899, 98434, 622, 20191, 520, 279, 99491, 10517, 304, 16132, 18059, 8019, 3297, 220, 17, 13, 578, 468, 4782, 12724, 466, 4870, 18824, 574, 2231, 1555, 813, 281, 2492, 389, 6740, 6693, 2391, 264, 47999, 26308, 520, 279, 42865, 23462, 304, 9853, 12167, 11, 1405, 12925, 447, 23332, 374, 3196, 369, 813, 4967, 13, 578, 63517, 79557, 3952, 311, 14318, 311, 4430, 264, 2835, 315, 1461, 30608, 279, 32249, 520, 279, 74175, 24833, 439, 568, 44599, 311, 5662, 16557, 7106, 17479, 369, 279, 4465, 304, 1120, 4848, 5672, 892, 13, 95255, 12925, 447, 23332, 8640, 709, 279, 7504, 315, 42865, 20371, 323, 8771, 23462, 439, 568, 28788, 369, 3297, 220, 17, 4465, 13, 578, 220, 1927, 4771, 6418, 35308, 709, 279, 7504, 315, 279, 74175, 5015, 439, 568, 48542, 369, 46899, 98434, 4465, 13, 12925, 447, 23332, 706, 1027, 68071, 813, 4967, 17942, 2533, 7314, 813, 4033, 4967, 3190, 13, 12925, 447, 23332, 8640, 709, 279, 7504, 315, 279, 24833, 439, 568, 44599, 311, 5662, 7340, 7106, 3044, 369, 279, 4465, 13, 26982, 12925, 447, 23332, 4194, 4752, 12786, 13883, 704, 7083, 23, 13, 19, 76, 389, 264, 19913, 502, 52528, 304, 58774, 25964, 11, 323, 19584, 279, 3568, 555, 10209, 3116, 14741, 311, 279, 4465, 2403, 98434, 13, 12925, 447, 23332, 19426, 279, 220, 605, 11, 931, 9518, 21117, 11, 8254, 67967, 3424, 304, 459, 14079, 4029, 304, 7188, 1120, 927, 264, 2305, 3201, 505, 813, 72708, 449, 279, 66671, 13827, 3778, 13, 1666, 1664, 439, 279, 3085, 315, 2326, 3, 717, 13, 20, 76, 11, 433, 574, 3116, 14741, 311, 832, 315, 279, 8706, 28533, 304, 46329, 3925, 520, 279, 99491, 10517, 304, 16132, 18059, 389, 3297, 220, 17, 430, 17948, 1461, 279, 3568, 13, 364, 2822, 10712, 433, 9087, 2965, 12925, 447, 23332, 596, 12675, 8479, 49064, 27562, 3309, 7427, 11450, 13482, 13, 364, 791, 37249, 527, 2294, 7359, 315, 46329, 323, 315, 95255, 11, 779, 433, 574, 264, 2466, 3568, 3238, 95255, 12925, 447, 23332, 706, 7318, 400, 717, 13, 20, 59413, 369, 264, 43828, 52528, 304, 58774, 25964, 11, 7188, 13, 578, 63517, 79557, 19426, 279, 3424, 1120, 927, 264, 2305, 704, 505, 813, 4465, 2403, 46899, 98434, 13, 12925, 447, 23332, 1101, 22982, 304, 3116, 14741, 311, 813, 4465, 2403, 98434, 520, 279, 99491, 10517, 304, 16132, 18059, 389, 3297, 220, 17, 382, 19791, 25], prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

Aaron Schock predicted in his farewell address on Thursday that like another Republican representative from Illinois who once held his seat, he would ultimately persevere. Schock said he would leave Capitol Hill with'sadness and humility', but he knows that 'God has a plan for' everyone. He offered no apology to other members of Congress, his constituents or taxpayers for a litany of lavish claims. Schock's downfall came after a Washington Post reporter discovered that he had redecorated his office in the style of acclaimed British television show Downton Abbey to the tune of $40,000, paid for by the taxpayer. Details of more lavish spending, including taking a private jet to Chicago for an NFL match - then billing it as'software' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO. SHAMED: Congressman Aaron Schock was revealed to be a lavish spender and offered a valedictory speech today which contained no apology but compared him to Lincoln. 'GOOD LUCK TONIGHT': Schock tweeted this Instagram selfie with singer Ariana Grande, 21, before the American \xa0Music Awards in November. IPHONE AT THE READY FOR HIS HOLINESS: Schock posted online a photo of him greeting Pope Francis in January on the 70th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp. Another trip saw him take a group of 20, including several interns to New York for a Katy Perry concert at a cost of $10,000. It was one of a series of celebrity events he attended and which were posted on his Instagram, featuring Arianna Grande and even Pope Francis. It was billed by Schock as a'very legitimate trip' as it coincided with a visit to the city by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He then posted a picture of himself with the Indian leader. The final blow was when Politico discovered that Schock had wrongly reported and been reimbursed for mileage on his personal vehicle - bought at taxpayers' expense. But he acknowledged nothing of that in his speech, instead using it to say he was going through 'defeats' like Lincoln - the president nicknamed 'Honest Abe' throughout his political career for his utter personal integrity. 'I also know that every person faces adversity in life. Abraham Lincoln held this seat in Congress in one term. But few faced as many defeats in his personal, business and public life as he did,' Schock said. FIRE YOURSELF: Schock bragged on Instagram in November after he met with real estate tycoon and possible presidential candidate Donald Trump at his Trump Tower office. 'THE PRESIDENTIAL': Schock's congressional office budget covered more than $5,000 for this custom podium, styled after the one President Obama uses when he's on the road. 'His continual perseverance in the face of these trials, never giving up, is something all of us Americans should be inspired by, especially when going through a valley in life.' A rising star in the Republican Party, and one of the youngest members of Congress from either political party, the flashy congressman, first attempted to weather the storm - hiring top-level communications strategists to help him beat back the charges - before announcing he would quit hours after his mileage claims came to light. In exiting Congress swiftly Schock avoided an ethics investigation from his peers. He could still be charged with criminal wrongdoing, however, and is now under investigation by federal law authorities for possible campaign finance violations, several news reports have indicated. Technically a Member of Congress until the end of the month, Schock said goodbye to his constituents and colleagues today as representatives prepared to head home for a two and a half week long recess built around the Easter holiday. The nearest he came to an apology was to speak of 'humility'. 'I was never more excited than the day I walked into this chamber six years ago. I leave here with sadness and humility,' Schock said on the House floor. 'For those whom I've let down, I will work tirelessly to make it up to you.' He could still be charged with criminal wrongdoing, however, and is now under investigation by federal law authorities for possible campaign finance violations, several news reports have indicated. Lincoln was first nicknamed Honest Abe when he was a store clerk in Springfield, Illinois, and the epithet stuck with him throughout his life. He used it as the 1859 presidential campaign slogan. RED IS THE COLOR:The lavish design appointments earned Schock snickers. REP. HARDBODY: Schock made a splash in May 2011 with this Men's Health magazine cover. Schock was correct that they had represented the same seat but Lincoln's sole term was not because he had to resign or because the voters kicked him out - he in fact was standing by his pledge that he would serve only one term. A Whig at the time he served in the federal legislature, Lincoln went on to become the 16th President of the United States, a position he held while the country was immersed in its first, and only, civil war. His Emancipation Proclamation freed the slaves in Confederate, southern states fighting against the Union. Sounding more optimistic than humiliated, Schock said today that he believes 'through life's struggles, we learn from our mistakes and we learn more about ourselves.' 'And I know that this is not the end of a story, but rather the beginning of a new chapter,' he added. 'Thank you for the honor to serve,' he said in at the conclusion of his remarks, nothing that he looks forward to keeping in touch with both his friends in Congress and in his district. He then left the House chamber - and an empty coffee cup, violating the legislature's rules - to applause. According to the Hill, three of his Republican colleagues - Jason Smith of Missouri, Kristi Noem of South Dakota and Mark Sanford of South Carolina - were waiting in the wings for him as he gave his speech. Sanford memorably rose from the ashes to take back his old congressional seat after leaving his state's governor's office in disgrace several years before. Following his first stint in Congress Sanford was elected and reelected as governor of South Carolina before he was caught cheating on his wife with an Argentinian mistress whom he later proposed to but never married. Still beloved in South Carolina by some of his former constituents Sanford reclaimed his House seat via a special election in 2013 and achieved reelection last fall. He ironically shares the same birthday with Schock. After Shock announced his resignation, his father said: 'Two years from now he’ll be successful, if he’s not in jail.'\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0,

Chris Coleman's Group B leaders host Belgium for their next qualifier but the June 12 fixture at the Cardiff City Stadium causes problems as far as preparation is concerned. The fixture comes nearly three weeks after the conclusion of the Premier League season and almost a full six weeks from the final match of the regular Championship campaign, which could mean an extended break for the likes of Reading pair Chris Gunter and Hal Robson-Kanu. Ashley Williams (right, with Gareth Bale) was in impressive form during Wales' win in Israel on Saturday. The Dragons currently sit top of Group B after their 3-0 impressive victory in Haifa, Israel. Gareth Bale (right) celebrates his first and Wales' second goal of the evening with team-mate Chris Gunter. Wales boss Coleman is still undecided whether to go ahead with a planned Cardiff friendly against Northern Ireland on June 4 or have a long training camp before the Belgium game. But Williams says that whatever the decision, Wales will not be taking their eye off the ball following the 3-0 victory in Israel on Saturday night, a win which gave the nation its longest unbeaten start to a qualifying campaign since the 1976 European Championships. 'There was a big wait for this game and it will be the same for the Belgium game in June,' Williams said. 'When the season ends we will get focused again and keep the ball rolling. Williams has his heart set on helping Wales qualify for their first ever European Championship finals. 'We have not spoken about that break yet and I don't know what they are going to do with us. 'But everyone understands the importance of that game and no-one is going to be in Vegas or Miami before. 'We will have a rest and keep ourselves fit.' Wales will lose top spot in the group on Tuesday night should the delayed Israel-Belgium game in Jerusalem produce a winner - the fixture postponed last September because of the political situation in the Middle East. Chris Coleman's men reached their target of being in the top three teams at the halfway mark of qualifying. But Coleman said Wales have met their pre-group target of being in the top three at the halfway stage of the qualifying campaign and, with seven or eight points potentially enough to claim one of the two automatic qualifying places for France 2016, three of their last five games are now at home. 'We have a massive game in June,' Williams said after winning his 50th cap against Israel in Haifa. 'A win over Belgium will be a big step to where we have to go. 'There is still a lot of football to be played after that so I wouldn't go as far as to say that we win that and we are there. 'We do know that a win over Belgium will make a big difference.

Northampton's 26-year-old lock returns to the starting XV as one of two changes from the setback in Dublin which dashed hopes of a Grand Slam for yet another year. The other sees Harlequins full back Mike Brown reinstated as Stuart Lancaster announced his line-up on Wednesday for the latest installment of an increasingly one-sided Calcutta Cup rivalry. Courtney Lawes will make a welcome return for England against Scotland at Twickenham on Saturday. Backs: M Brown (Harlequins); A Watson (Bath), J Joseph (Bath), L Burrell (Northampton), J Nowell (Exeter); G Ford (Bath), B Youngs (Leicester) Forwards:\xa0J Marler (Harlequins), D Hartley (Northampton), D Cole (Leicester); D Attwood (Bath), C Lawes (Northampton); J Haskell (Wasps), B Vunipola (Saracens), C Robshaw (Harlequins, C) Subs: T Youngs (Leicester), M Vunipola (Saracens), K Brookes (Newcastle), G Parling (Leicester), T Wood (Northampton), R Wigglesworth (Saracens), D Cipriani (Sale), B Twelvetrees (Gloucester) Lawes will add clout and dynamism up front to Stuart Lancaster's side reeling from their loss to Ireland. Head coach Lancaster said: 'There's always a lot of competition for places and having experienced players like Courtney, Tom and Geoff available after playing well for their clubs in the last few weeks adds to our options. 'It's been an intense two weeks of training as everyone wants to be on that field on Saturday and we've had to make some tough selection calls.' Lawes will win his 37th Test cap against the Scots, having proved his fitness with the Saints after being out for two months with an ankle injury. Two comeback club matches have been enough to convince the England management that he is primed to reignite their championship campaign. Reuniting Lawes with Dave Attwood in the second row means George Kruis of Saracens is out of the match-day 23, for the time being. Having dipped against Ireland after storming displays in the wins over Wales and Italy, the rookie has made way, with Leicester's Lion, Geoff Parling, coming on to the bench along with flanker Tom Wood - another back from injury - and prop Kieran Brookes. Full back Mike Brown will also be back when Lancaster announces his side on Wednesday. Brown takes part in full training at Bagshot on Tuesday as England prepare for the Calcutta Cup. Forwards coach Graham Rowntree said: 'Courtney is a special player. He's been good for us. He's really maturing as a player and as a person. You can't hide what he can bring for us physically. I've watched his last two games for Northampton and he's played well. This time last year, on the summer tour and in the autumn series, he played exceptionally well and he's back to his best. 'We've got a lot of athletes in the second row. I've been very pleased with the progress of the guys who have been performing in the absence of Courtney and Geoff over the last few months. But we have a lot of riches in that area now.' For many years, Lawes has been acclaimed for his destructive impact as a tackler and athletic ball-carrier but Rowntree insisted he is equally adept at doing the unglamorous duties required from a tight forward. Lawes reunites with Dave Attwood while Geoff Parling (pictured) comes back onto the bench. Flanker Tom Wood (pictured) also returns from injury, as will prop Kieran Brookes. 'He is capable of the 'grunt' work,' he said. 'That area of his game has significantly improved, his work-rate. That's what you get with Courtney: high work-rate but also a lot of stand-out moments.' The reshuffle of the impressive lock stocks extends to a recall for Parling as a replacement after the first half of his season was disrupted by concussion. He has forged a reputation as a supreme lineout operator but Rowntree also paid tribute to his carrying efforts in recent seasons, and his leadership as an experienced figure who was a mainstay of the Lions' success in Australia in 2013. Forwards coach Graham Rowntree describes Lawes as 'a special player' for what he brings physically. Rowtree expects a high work-rate along with some stand-out moments from Lawes on Saturday. England's defeat in Dublin was notable as a rare off-day for captain Chris Robshaw, who had been leading the side with increasing authority of late. Rowntree didn't duck the fact that the skipper needs to raise his game again. 'I've been happy with Chris this last six months,' he said. 'He did well in the autumn, against Leinster too, injured his shoulder then came back to be outstanding against Wales. He played well against Italy but, among a lot of other guys, did not have his best game in Ireland against a very good outfit in terms of breakdown and set-piece. Chris Robshaw had a rare off day against Ireland but Rowntree expects the England skipper to bounce back. 'We have had frank reviews and I'm sure we will have a reaction from Chris this week. This group are very good at putting their hands up. Chris leads that. One of his greatest qualities is his honesty.' Robshaw acknowledged the collective need to lift standards back up to where they were in Cardiff. He will be hoping Wales scupper Irish Grand Slam hopes before trying to deal with the expectation of a resounding home win against Scotland. 'There are different pressures,' he said. 'We're favourites going into that game at home. 'You want to deliver and set the standard of how you want to play. Hopefully we win, but hopefully we do it in the right manner.'\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0,

Please output the summary only, without any other text.\n\nArticle:\nFormer Vice President Dick Cheney, defending the GOP against charges of bigotry, says its President Barack Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder who are 'playing the race card' and not the other way around. 'To say that we criticize, or that I criticize, Barack Obama or Eric Holder because of race, I just think it’s obviously not true,' Cheney said. 'My view of it is the criticism is merited because of performance—or lack of performance, because of incompetence. It hasn’t got anything to do with race.' Cheney addressed the subject during a 10-hour long interview with journalist James Rosen, a portion of which appeared on Playboy's website late Tuesday night. Former Vice President Dick Cheney, seen here on the set of Meet the Press in December, says it's 'obviously not true' that GOP criticisms of President Barack Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder are race-related. 'Certainly we haven’t given up—nor should we give up—the right to criticize an administration and public officials,' the former George W. Bush administration and George H.W. Bush administration official said after Rosen asked him if there is any 'truth' to past suggestions by Obama and Holder that Republican opposition to the president is race-related. Holder has conjectured numerous times that Republican hostility to the president and his policies are based, at least partly, on Obama's race. Obama, whose father is Kenyan, is half black. He has strongly embraced his African-American heritage, as has his wife, Michelle Obama, whose mother\xa0Marian Robinson lives at the White House with the first family and has made it known in the past that it was preferable to her  that her son-in-law wasn't 'completely white.' The soon-to-be retired attorney general is also black. He again claimed in an interview several weeks ago with Politico that racism was sometimes an underlying factor in the administration's struggles with congressional Republicans. 'There have been times when I thought that’s at least a piece of it,' Holder acknowledged. 'I think that the primary motivator has probably been political in nature … [but] you can’t let it deflect you from … your eyes on the prize.' Cheney also chastised\xa0the Obama administration in his sit-down with Rosen for habitually viewing large-scale controversies through the frame of race. Discussing the Ferguson, Missouri, shooting of a young black man by a white police officer, Cheney said he's 'been disappointed' with the executive branch's response to the tragedy. 'It seems to me it’s a clear-cut case that the officer did what he had to do to defend himself. He was perfectly within his authorities to take action,' Cheney asserted. 'That if you reach through the open car window and slap an officer upside the head and reach for his gun, you know, there is going to be a response. 'I think there should have been more people who were ready to stand up and say, “Look, the evidence is pretty overwhelming. The grand jury has reviewed it thoroughly. Here’s what we know. This is what happened.”'Continuing, he said, the administration was wrong to have allowed race to cloud the debate. 'We should not sort of throw it all over on the burden of race, or racial inequality or racial discrimination, as being responsible for this particular event,' he argued. 'I think that would be wrong, and [pauses] it bothers me that that kind of an incident has generated that kind of response. 'I don’t think it is about race. I think it is about an individual who conducted himself in a manner that was almost guaranteed to provoke an officer trying to do his duty.' It's President Barack Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder, seated here in the Roosevelt Room of the White House in February with Senior Adviser to the President Valerie Jarrett, who are 'playing the race card' and not the other way around, Cheney charged. He further took Obama to task over decisions he's made in the last six years as commander in chief, since taking the baton from George W. Bush in 2009, that Cheney, the former No. 2 government official, believes are to the detriment of America and have led to the unraveling of the stability abroad that he and Bush helped put in place. 'Oh absolutely. Where do you start?' Cheney replied when Rosen nudged him to say that Obama had 'intentionally' or 'inadvertently' undone his predecessor's work. Passing judgement on the Democratic president's handling of Iraq, Cheney said it was a 'huge mistake' for Obama to withdraw troops and 'we are paying a price for it now.' 'He’s having to go back in now, and the guy who campaigned on the basis of bring the boys home and get out of Iraq is now redeploying forces to Iraq,' he said, referencing the fight against ISIS. Obama's so-called 'apology tour' in Cairo, Egypt in 2009 was also 'a huge mistake,' Cheney proclaimed. 'I don’t think he ever bought into the notion that we’re at war, in terms of a war on terrorism; I think he always wanted to treat it as a law-enforcement problem. 'I think he’s done enormous damage to the military,' Cheney, a former defense secretary under Bush senior said, repeating old lines of attack on Obama, who had no military experience when he took office. 'The way Obama is functioning now, he’s crippling the capacity of future presidents to deal with future crises' by cutting its size. 'It takes a long time to build up that military force.' Cheney said he is 'absolutely convinced' that a future president 'will be faced with a major crisis and will not have the military capability he needs to deal with it' because of Obama's actions. 'I can go on for hours,' he said, before cutting himself off. Cheney, left, served as the vice president in George W. Bush's administration. They are pictured here talking to the press in the Oval Office in 2002 ahead of Cheney's 10-day trip across the Middle East and Europe to discuss with allies the Iraq situation. While Obama has advocated for a leaner military, it is, ironically, conservatives in Congress who are currently standing in the way of a massive increase in defense spending to replace the armed services divisions depleted coffers. Obama has called for an end to defense spending caps demanded by sequestration legislation as part of his fiscal year 2016 budget. Defense hawks on the right also want to re-up the defense department's resources. But fiscal conservatives believe that fulfilling the party's promise to balance the budget over the next decade and put a dent in the federal deficit is of greater importance. The official budget put forward by House Republicans on Tuesday leaves the sequester in place while instead expanding an overseas account for the military. The White House on Tuesday called it a'slush fund' intended to give Republicans, generally known as aggressively in favor of the military, 'political cover' while Senate Armed Services Chairman John McCain, a former Republican presidential nominee' described it as a gimmick.\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0,

Please output the summary only, without any other text.\n\nArticle:\nThe word 'lunatic' itself was derived from the Latin word for moon 'luna,' as many were convinced that the celestial body could cause disease and strange behaviour. And it's a theory that persists today, with many people believing that a full moon is more likely to coincide with hectic periods in hospitals or in birth wards. But Dr Jean-Luc Margot, a professor of planetary astronomy at the University of California, has carried out a study that proves that\xa0the concept is essentially rubbish. A researcher from the University of California says that claims the moon causes illnesses are rubbish.\xa0Dr Margot said that when life is hectic on the day of a full moon, many people remember the association because it confirms their belief - but they do not remember when nothing in particular happens on such a day. His\xa0research\xa0was carried out to\xa0illustrate how intelligent and otherwise reasonable people develop strong beliefs that are not aligned with reality. 'The absence of a lunar influence on human affairs has been demonstrated in the areas of automobile accidents, hospital admissions, surgery outcomes, cancer survival rates, menstruation, births, birth complications, depression, violent behaviour, and even criminal activity', Dr Margot writes. Even though a 40-year-old UCLA study demonstrated that the timing of births does not correlate in any way with the lunar cycle, the belief in a lunar effect has persisted. A full moon is when it is on the opposite side of  Earth from the sun. This means its entire surface is lit up by the sun, making it especially bright. A new moon is when it is in the same direction as the sun, so its 'far side' is lit, and it can barely be seen in Earth's sky. On average, the moon is 239,000 miles (384,000km) from Earth and takes 27 days, seven hours, 43 minutes and 11.6 seconds to complete one orbit. A 2004 study in a nursing journal, for example, suggested that the full moon influenced the number of hospital admissions in a medical unit in Barcelona, Spain. But Dr Margot identified multiple flaws in the data collection and analysis of the 2004 research. By re-analysing the data, he showed that the number of admissions was unrelated to the lunar cycle. 'The moon is innocent,' Dr Margot said. Dr Margot cited what scientists refer to as the 'confirmation bias' - people's tendency to interpret information in a way that confirms their beliefs and ignore data that contradict them. When life is hectic on the day of a full moon, many people remember the association because it confirms their belief. But hectic days that do not correspond with a full moon are promptly ignored and forgotten because they do not reinforce the belief. The moon is even blamed when things get crazy at hospital emergency rooms (stock image shown) or birth wards. 'Some nurses ascribe the apparent chaos to the moon, but dozens of studies show that the belief is unfounded,' said Dr Jean-Luc Margot, a UCLA professor of planetary astronomy. Dr Margot said the societal costs of flawed beliefs can be enormous. In just one current example, the recent measles outbreak appears to have been triggered by parents' questionable beliefs about the safety of the measles vaccine. 'Vaccines are widely and correctly regarded as one of the greatest public health achievements, yet vaccine-preventable diseases are killing people because of beliefs that are out of step with scientific facts,' Dr Margot said. A willingness to engage in evidence-based reasoning and admit that one's beliefs may be incorrect will produce a more accurate view of the world and result in better decision-making, he said. 'Perhaps we can start by correcting our delusions about the moon, and work from there,' Dr Margot added. The study was published online by the journal Nursing Research.\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0,

But this morning Ed Balls admitted that he relies on his mother-in-law June for help with maths. At the end of an interview on Good Morning Britain, Labour’s shadow chancellor said he was relieved he had not been asked to answer any maths questions live on TV. Labour shadow chancellor Ed Balls told Good Morning Britain his mother was the family's maths brain. Last month during an interview on the ITV breakfast show, Education Secretary Nicky Morgan was left embarrassed when she refused to answer what 7x8 is. After appearing on the programme this morning to discuss George Osborne’s Budget, Mr Balls told host Susanna Reid: ‘I was pleased you didn’t ask me any maths questions this morning, that was my…’ Asked how he was with fractions, Mr Balls replied: ‘Luckily my mother-in-law is a maths teacher so she is the expert when it comes to maths.’ A shocked Miss Reid interrupted: ‘You cannot tell me that the shadow chancellor relies on this mother in law to do his maths.’ He added: ‘The kids think the mother-in-law is very good at maths teaching. You always rely on your mother in law.’ Good Morning Britain host Susanna Reid asked Mr Balls if he really left all the maths questions to his mother in law. He replied: 'You always rely on your mother-in-law' The morning after the Budget, Mr Balls warned that Mr Osborne's plan for cuts was ‘a pretty scary prospect’ for voters. Mr Balls has three children with his wife, Labour’s shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper. Her mother June, is a maths teacher and her father, Tony, a trade unionist. After working as an adviser to Gordon Brown at the Treasury, Mr Balls was elected as an MP in 2005 and became shadow chancellor in 2011. He previously worked at the Financial Times and taught economics at Harvard University. Last month Mrs Morgan refused to do mental arithmetic during an appearance on Good Morning Britain to discuss plans to improve the performance of schools in England. When asked what the answer to 7x8 is, she said: ‘I'm not going to be answering any maths questions.’ Mr Balls has three children with his wife, Labour’s shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper. Mr Balls warned that Mr Osborne's plan for cuts was ‘a pretty scary prospect’ for voters. ‘For all his boasts, people are worse-off than they were and the squeeze on living standards has been very severe,’ Mr Balls later told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ‘If you look at his plans for the next parliament, as the independent OBR say, the cuts in public spending under the Osborne plan are more severe in the next three years than in the last five. ‘His desire to get to an overall surplus by 2019/20 means even bigger cuts in the next three years to our police, our defence forces than we've seen in the last few years. ‘I don't think those cuts are going to be possible for George Osborne. He's going to end up either cutting our National Health Service or raising VAT. ‘The truth at the election will be, do you want Labour's more balanced, fairer approach to deficit reduction, which focuses on raising wages and being fair, or do you want to go for even deeper spending cuts over the next three years?’\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=128, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=False, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: [128000, 9370, 5730, 553, 279, 2768, 3754, 4652, 304, 220, 4386, 11460, 13, 5321, 2612, 279, 12399, 1193, 11, 2085, 904, 1023, 1495, 382, 17064, 512, 1548, 6944, 311, 3719, 48063, 315, 279, 1398, 1557, 16339, 13, 2030, 420, 6693, 3279, 71703, 16584, 430, 568, 34744, 389, 813, 6691, 3502, 31412, 5651, 369, 1520, 449, 71808, 13, 2468, 279, 842, 315, 459, 7274, 389, 7839, 29084, 13527, 11, 18993, 753, 12737, 77275, 1071, 568, 574, 51512, 568, 1047, 539, 1027, 4691, 311, 4320, 904, 71808, 4860, 3974, 389, 6007, 13, 18993, 12737, 77275, 3279, 71703, 3309, 7839, 29084, 13527, 813, 6691, 574, 279, 3070, 596, 71808, 8271, 13, 8155, 2305, 2391, 459, 7274, 389, 279, 94455, 17954, 1501, 11, 11930, 12667, 15341, 88, 23809, 574, 2163, 49230, 994, 1364, 16436, 311, 4320, 1148, 220, 22, 87, 23, 374, 13, 4740, 26449, 389, 279, 18629, 420, 6693, 311, 4358, 10058, 71229, 753, 28368, 11, 4491, 71703, 3309, 3552, 16687, 12930, 38774, 25, 3451, 40, 574, 18949, 499, 3287, 1431, 2610, 757, 904, 71808, 4860, 420, 6693, 11, 430, 574, 856, 1981, 529, 53763, 1268, 568, 574, 449, 65995, 11, 4491, 71703, 20592, 25, 3451, 96850, 856, 6691, 3502, 31412, 374, 264, 71808, 11326, 779, 1364, 374, 279, 6335, 994, 433, 4131, 311, 71808, 14639, 362, 27718, 9083, 38774, 37883, 25, 3451, 2675, 4250, 3371, 757, 430, 279, 12737, 77275, 34744, 389, 420, 6691, 304, 2383, 311, 656, 813, 71808, 14639, 1283, 3779, 25, 3451, 791, 6980, 1781, 279, 6691, 3502, 31412, 374, 1633, 1695, 520, 71808, 12917, 13, 1472, 2744, 17631, 389, 701, 6691, 304, 2383, 14639, 7839, 29084, 13527, 3552, 16687, 12930, 38774, 4691, 4491, 71703, 422, 568, 2216, 2163, 682, 279, 71808, 4860, 311, 813, 6691, 304, 2383, 13, 1283, 20592, 25, 364, 2675, 2744, 17631, 389, 701, 6691, 3502, 31412, 6, 578, 6693, 1306, 279, 28368, 11, 4491, 71703, 19201, 430, 4491, 71229, 596, 3197, 369, 15455, 574, 3451, 64, 5128, 29565, 22199, 529, 369, 11969, 13, 4491, 71703, 706, 2380, 2911, 449, 813, 7555, 11, 18993, 753, 12737, 2162, 19607, 816, 58330, 24421, 13, 6385, 6691, 5651, 11, 374, 264, 71808, 11326, 323, 1077, 7126, 11, 19036, 11, 264, 6696, 11552, 380, 13, 4740, 3318, 439, 459, 32853, 311, 26952, 10690, 520, 279, 32991, 11, 4491, 71703, 574, 16689, 439, 459, 9599, 304, 220, 1049, 20, 323, 6244, 12737, 77275, 304, 220, 679, 16, 13, 1283, 8767, 6575, 520, 279, 17961, 8691, 323, 15972, 28989, 520, 25996, 3907, 13, 8155, 2305, 18083, 23809, 16436, 311, 656, 10723, 35884, 2391, 459, 11341, 389, 7839, 29084, 13527, 311, 4358, 6787, 311, 7417, 279, 5178, 315, 8853, 304, 9635, 13, 3277, 4691, 1148, 279, 4320, 311, 220, 22, 87, 23, 374, 11, 1364, 1071, 25, 3451, 40, 2846, 539, 2133, 311, 387, 36864, 904, 71808, 4860, 14639, 4491, 71703, 706, 2380, 2911, 449, 813, 7555, 11, 18993, 753, 12737, 2162, 19607, 816, 58330, 24421, 13, 4491, 71703, 19201, 430, 4491, 71229, 596, 3197, 369, 15455, 574, 3451, 64, 5128, 29565, 22199, 529, 369, 11969, 13, 3451, 2520, 682, 813, 38119, 11, 1274, 527, 11201, 12744, 1109, 814, 1051, 323, 279, 37663, 389, 5496, 10886, 706, 1027, 1633, 15748, 23189, 4491, 71703, 3010, 3309, 18588, 13792, 220, 19, 596, 11450, 18629, 13, 3451, 2746, 499, 1427, 520, 813, 6787, 369, 279, 1828, 21814, 11, 439, 279, 9678, 507, 13396, 2019, 11, 279, 15455, 304, 586, 10374, 1234, 279, 71229, 3197, 527, 810, 15748, 304, 279, 1828, 2380, 1667, 1109, 304, 279, 1566, 4330, 13, 3451, 16366, 12876, 311, 636, 311, 459, 8244, 41548, 555, 220, 679, 24, 14, 508, 3445, 1524, 11493, 15455, 304, 279, 1828, 2380, 1667, 311, 1057, 4379, 11, 1057, 23682, 8603, 1109, 584, 3077, 3970, 304, 279, 1566, 2478, 1667, 13, 3451, 40, 1541, 956, 1781, 1884, 15455, 527, 2133, 311, 387, 3284, 369, 10058, 71229, 13, 1283, 596, 2133, 311, 842, 709, 3060, 14713, 1057, 5165, 6401, 5475, 477, 19054, 48692, 13, 3451, 791, 8206, 520, 279, 6355, 690, 387, 11, 656, 499, 1390, 18993, 596, 810, 24770, 11, 6762, 261, 5603, 311, 29287, 14278, 11, 902, 24400, 389, 19054, 23998, 323, 1694, 6762, 11, 477, 656, 499, 1390, 311, 733, 369, 1524, 19662, 10374, 15455, 927, 279, 1828, 2380, 1667, 30, 30184, 19791, 25], prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

Henry has hailed Rooney as one of the greats of the game with the 29-year-old England captain just two goals from equalling Sir Bobby Charlton's record of 49 goals for his country. And the former Arsenal and Barcelona striker insists that young players like Harry Kane and Raheem Sterling must not waste their training sessions alongside Rooney. Thierry Henry (right) and Wayne Rooney pictured alongside each other during a Premier League match in 2002. Wayne Rooney celebrates his 47th goal for England against Lithuania on Friday night. Henry wrote in The Sun: 'You will only truly appreciate Rooney when he has retired. It's a shame but it's always like hat. 'I would absolutely urge all those youngsters in the squad, such as Raheem Sterling and Harry Kane, to watch and learn off Rooney from this day onwards. 'They are extremely lucky to be on the same training pitch as this guy and they must make the most of it. It will be a real waste if they do not. 'They must try to copy him. In terms of his dedication and the way he plays. I would also say this to the young lads at Manchester United. Rooney heads in the opening goal past Lithuania goalkeeper Giedrius Arlauskis at Wembley. Rooney heads the ball past Arlauskis to give England the lead in Friday's Euro 2016 qualifier. 'To play well for six months or a season in football is nothing. To do so for over a decade like Rooney is extraordinary. I know what it takes and it isn't easy. 'Trust me, people talk about him outside of this country. In Spain and France, he is appreciated as a top, top player.' Meanwhile, Rooney has admitted that the excitement generated by Kane, who scored just 79 seconds after coming on as a substitute in the 4-0 win over Lithuania, reminds him of his early games for England at the age of 17. Rooney was a teenage sensation for England twelve years ago and caused even more of a stir when he starred in England’s 2-0 win over Turkey in 2003. Rooney said: ‘There was one stage in the game, after his [Kane's] goal, where he ran down the left and took a few players on which reminded me of that. Tottenham striker Harry Kane celebrates scoring his first goal for England on his debut. Kane (left) headed in England's fourth against Lithuania shortly after replacing England captain Rooney. Wayne Rooney (right) praised Harry Kane's immediate impact for England against Lithuania. ‘But he will tell you himself he still has a lot to learn but at the minute he is scoring goals left right and centre and it is great for us as a nation to have that excitement around us. ‘It's incredible really. You can feel the excitement around the country. You could tell when he came on everyone wanted him to come on and even he himself didn't think he'd score so quick, but we are all delighted for him. 'He's an exciting player. When you speak to him you can see he is a level headed guy and I am sure he has good people around him so will be able to cope with it. Rooney starred on his England debut against Turkey in 2003, at the age of 17. Rooney (centre) said Kane's debut reminded him of his early games for his country. ‘There are things I could say to advise him but I think there are things you have to learn on your own, which I am sure he will do in the next year or two. 'He is obviously a little bit older than I was and a bit wiser as I was 16 or 17 when I came in. But he is level headed and can cope. ‘I think people try to help you but it is best to learn on your own. When you are a young lad you do make mistakes and you have to learn from them because it will make you a better player.’\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0,

The man has admitted stabbing three women aged 59, 76 and 84, as well as two men aged 62 and 82, Deputy Police Chief Keizo Okumoto told CNN. He said the accused refused to comment further as he was awaiting his lawyer. The victims -- two couples and the 84-year-old woman -- lived within 100 meters (330 feet) of the suspect's home, police said. According to local media, the accused and the victims shared the same surname, but it is unclear if they are related. Sumoto city is on Awaji Island, Hyogo prefecture, in Japan. CNN's Susannah Cullinane contributed to this report from London.\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=128, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=False, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: [128000, 9370, 5730, 553, 279, 2768, 3754, 4652, 304, 220, 4386, 11460, 13, 5321, 2612, 279, 12399, 1193, 11, 2085, 904, 1023, 1495, 382, 17064, 512, 53954, 16417, 320, 56555, 8, 22993, 304, 6457, 2019, 814, 617, 12800, 264, 220, 1272, 4771, 6418, 893, 13487, 315, 72461, 72022, 4330, 19228, 304, 264, 33489, 4029, 304, 8279, 2117, 3363, 13, 578, 893, 706, 16584, 72022, 2380, 3278, 20330, 220, 2946, 11, 220, 4767, 323, 220, 5833, 11, 439, 1664, 439, 1403, 3026, 20330, 220, 5538, 323, 220, 6086, 11, 32724, 10289, 14681, 6706, 43994, 7777, 372, 2117, 3309, 20352, 13, 1283, 1071, 279, 13487, 16436, 311, 4068, 4726, 439, 568, 574, 45088, 813, 15779, 13, 578, 12697, 1198, 1403, 21961, 323, 279, 220, 5833, 4771, 6418, 5333, 1198, 12439, 2949, 220, 1041, 20645, 320, 10568, 7693, 8, 315, 279, 15562, 596, 2162, 11, 4379, 1071, 13, 10771, 311, 2254, 3772, 11, 279, 13487, 323, 279, 12697, 6222, 279, 1890, 40853, 11, 719, 433, 374, 25420, 422, 814, 527, 5552, 13, 8279, 2117, 3363, 374, 389, 18371, 42888, 10951, 11, 10320, 24404, 90545, 554, 11, 304, 6457, 13, 20352, 596, 16687, 44104, 356, 620, 258, 2194, 20162, 311, 420, 1934, 505, 7295, 382, 19791, 25], prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

Please output the summary only, without any other text.\n\nArticle:\nSean Dyche's Burnley earned a shock win against Manchester City to boost their survival hopes and all but end the Manuel Pellegrini's side's hopes of catching Chelsea at the top of the table. The only goal of the game came from midfielder George Boyd who expertly fired home a volley past Joe Hart in the City goal. Burnley's win sends them above relegation threatened QPR and leaves Manchester City five points adrift of Chelsea having played two more games than their west London rivals. Find out how each player fared at Turf Moor with Sportmail's Craig Hope. BURNLEY (4-4-2) Tom Heaton 6.5 – Made a smart save from Dzeko in the first half but will have expected to be tested far more by the champions. Kieran Trippier 6.5 – Wasn’t able to get forward as much as usual but stuck to his defensive duties and made a great interception header early on. Michael Duff 6.5 – Recalled to the line-up in place of Keane and hardly put a foot wrong. Booked for a foul on Aguero. Manchester City's Belgian defender Vincent Kompanyis closed down by Burnley striker Danny Ings. Jason Shackell 7 – A real captain’s display alongside Duff in central defence to keep City’s threat to a bare minimum. Ben Mee 6 – Former City trainee had his hands full with Zabaleta and was very fortunate not to concede a penalty when he brought him down late on. George Boyd 8 – Had already gone close with a spectacular volley from the edge of the box before firing the winner with the sweetest of strikes. Scott Arfield 7 – Tested Hart with decent effort in the first half but excelled in a central, working tirelessly to hold City at bay. Manchester City's Pablo Zabaleta and Burnley's Ashley Barnes battle for the ball  at Turf Moor. David Jones 7 – Another solid performance from the former Manchester United man, holding things together for Burnley in the heart of midfield. Ashley Barnes 6 – Showed his versatility by moving wide out on the left to accommodate Vokes and never stopped running. Danny Ings 7 – Posed a constant problem for Demichelis, and got the Argentine’s forearm in the face for his troubles. Edin Dzeko  holds off Barnes  during the Premier League match between Burnley and Manchester City. Sam Vokes 6.5 – His first Premier League start for Burnley after a knee injury and kept Kompany on his toes throughout. Subs: Gilks, Keane, Reid (for Ings 90+3), Ward (for Vokes 87), Jutkiewicz, Wallace, Kightly. Scorer: Boyd 61. Booked: Mee, Duff. MAN CITY (4-4-2) Joe Hart 6 – The England keeper had little to do besides pick the ball out of the net and couldn’t be faulted for conceding Boyd’s winner. Pablo Zabaleta 6.5 – Got forward well as usual but his hard work came to nothing as City wasted what few opportunities came their way. Sergio Aguero  evades the challenge of Michael Duff  during the  match between Burnley and Manchester City. Vincent Kompany 6 – City skipper was recalled after being dropped for one game, and his clearance header went straight to Boyd for Burnley’s goal. Martin Demichelis 5 – Struggled to contain Ings. Booked for taking down the Burnley striker and could have seen red for a foul on Trippier shortly afterwards. Gael Clichy 5 – Failed to get forward enough and offer City a threat down the left. Will now sit out the Barcelona game through suspension. Jesus Navas 5 – Another lack-lustre showing from the Spain winger who incurred the wrath of Burnley fans who thought he overreacted to get Mee booked. Manchester City's Brazilian midfielder Fernandinho looks on during the  match against Burnley  at Turf Moor. Yaya Toure 6 – Tried to prompt City into life from midfield but there were none of the driving runs that can make him almost unplayable at times. Fernandinho 5 – Spent the last week in the headlines for his alleged bust-up with Kompany but did very little of note here apart from one volley high over the bar. David Silva 5.5 – Strangely subdued display from the Spaniard who is so often City’s creative spark. Subbed by Jovetic having contributed very little. English striker Danny Ings stretches for the ball during the  match between Burnley and Manchester City. Sergio Aguero 5.5 – City’s top scorer was off target with a series of attempts on goal and was lucky to escape punishment for a naughty challenge on Duff. Edin Dzeko 4.5 – A first-time shot that almost hit the corner flag summed up his display and no surprise to see him replaced by Bony with half an hour left. Subs: Caballero, Sagna, Mangala, Nasri, Lampard (for Toure 81), Jovetic (for Silva 74), Bony (for Dzeko 63). Booked: Demichelis. Referee: Andre Marriner 5. Star man: George Boyd. Manchester City's Spanish midfielder David Silva vies with Burnley's English midfielder David Jones.\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0,

Amanda Bushe won the money as part of the morning show's Knock of Cash promotion, when weatherman Steven Jacobs arrived on the doorstep of her Eschol Park home to surprise the pregnant single mum. Ms Bushe eventually emerged wearing her dressing gown, and explained she has been unable to work during her pregnancy. Sydney mum Amanda Bushe, who won $10,000 on the Today Show this morning, has hit back at trolls who attacked her for not deserving the prize. She said the money would'massively' change her life. Ms Bushe also said she had recently been served with an eviction notice as a result of not being able to pay the rent. Her friend, Nicole, who nominated her for the prize said Ms Bush is 'one of the strongest and most lovely women' she has met, and very deserving of the cash. However, viewers of the show quickly took to Today's Facebook page, attacking her justification for being job-less. 'I didn't know your (sic) could get evicted for being pregnant, must be another reason!!! and she said she only took kids in to look after them that's not a foster parent because foster parents get paid to do that,' one person wrote. Channel Nine weatherman Steven Jacobs arrived on Ms Bushes doorstep as part of the Today Show's Knock of Cash competition. Ms Bushe, who answered the door in her dressing gown, initially slammed the door in the presenter's face. 'This annoys me! It's called priorities! I was a single mum with two kids one with a disability for 8yrs, no family to help me and I never once was not able to pay my bills!' another commented. 'How about giving away cash to the average bloke & lady that work long hrs that are on a low wages just to give them a break well like that will ever happen these shows & radio shows always go after people with all the problems in world,' one Facebook user complained. Ms Bushe then leaped to her own defence, and swung back at the trolls attacking her. She explained that she had slept for little more than an hour overnight due to her medical condition, which explained her seemingly dazed and confused state when first opening the door. 'I opened the door in my robe (that didn't have a tie) having no idea who was there and to be honest was a bit worried having a mic shoved in my face by a complete stranger not knowing what was going on,' she wrote. Online trolls attacked the mum's win, saying she 'didn't have her priorities in order' and that her pregnancy wouldn't have caused her not to have a job. Ms Bushe quickly leaped to her own defence. 'I was in a good job and a comfortable position before I fell pregnant and was able to afford these luxuries' she said. 'As for my piercings and tattoos. I was in a good job and a comfortable position before I fell pregnant and was able to afford these luxuries. I didn't get pregnant then run off and decide to get a million piercings.' 'As for fostering kids I don't do this through foster care. I have taken kids in that have been kicked out of home and have nowhere to go. 'So to answer some questions in here no I don't get anything for it.' Other users quickly began to throw their support behind Ms Bushe, and started hitting back at the 'cruel hearted' and'small minded' people who were critical of her win. 'Australia has become such a nasty country! So jealous that you all have to put this lady down when you don't know her situation and don't forget she's been a foster mum to many kids.'\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1,

Please output the summary only, without any other text.\n\nArticle:\nA teacher in Ohio has filed a lawsuit claiming that he was fired 'because he opposed dairy farming, on his personal Facebook page, on his own time.' Keith Allison of Smithville was a second grade title one teacher at Green Elementary School working with small groups of kids who needed extra help with their math and English. According to a lawsuit filed on Wednesday at the U.S. District Court in Cleveland, school administrators told him he his contract wouldn't be renewed because of photos he had posted online showing baby calves in small crates. Keith Allison of Smithville, Ohio, has filed a lawsuit claiming that he was fired by Green Local School District 'because he opposed dairy farming, on his personal Facebook page, on his own time' Along with the photos, Allison - who is a vegan – had also posted a message voicing his support for animals rights. 'As someone who grew up feeling parental love and support, and now as a parent who gives love and support, I reject the claim that separating babies from loving mothers to raise them isolated in boxes can ever be considered humane,' he wrote on the post. Allison was told by his superintendent that the family that owns this farm had called and complained about it and said they were upset and frightened by the post. 'The fact that their family's farm was in the picture, I guess, is where their complaint was coming from and from what I was told, they were fearful, afraid that someone might come and break their calf crates or free their cows and their children were not safe to be out in their yards,' he told Fox 8. 'During the meeting with my superintendent, I was informed we live in a large agricultural area, which is true, and that a lot of our money for the schools comes through residents of the community and that I needed to be very careful of what i put on (Facebook) because I might offend the community and the economic interests of the community,' said Allison. According to a lawsuit, school administrators told him he his contract wouldn't be renewed because of photos he had posted online showing baby calves in small crates (stock photo) 'I was also told that I could have any personal beliefs I want to have, but if I want to be a strong Vegan advocate, I might want to look into doing something other than teaching.' The lawsuit says the Board of Education of Green Local School District has a policy that teachers cannot speak about issues if members of the community disagree with their views. Allison and the American Civil Liberties Union, which filed the lawsuit on his behalf, say the policy is unconstitutional and are suing the district to remove it. They are also asking for back pay and damages and to reinstate him into his old position, even though he was hired at a middle school in the district in January.\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=128, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=False, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: [128000, 9370, 5730, 553, 279, 2768, 3754, 4652, 304, 220, 4386, 11460, 13, 5321, 2612, 279, 12399, 1193, 11, 2085, 904, 1023, 1495, 382, 17064, 512, 32, 11326, 304, 14689, 706, 13019, 264, 19831, 21039, 430, 568, 574, 14219, 364, 28753, 568, 16475, 34479, 33489, 11, 389, 813, 4443, 5690, 2199, 11, 389, 813, 1866, 892, 3238, 32602, 63508, 315, 9259, 8078, 574, 264, 2132, 12239, 2316, 832, 11326, 520, 7997, 41763, 6150, 3318, 449, 2678, 5315, 315, 6980, 889, 4460, 5066, 1520, 449, 872, 7033, 323, 6498, 13, 10771, 311, 264, 19831, 13019, 389, 8079, 520, 279, 549, 815, 13, 11182, 7301, 304, 24372, 11, 2978, 38212, 3309, 1461, 568, 813, 5226, 8434, 956, 387, 36646, 1606, 315, 7397, 568, 1047, 8621, 2930, 9204, 8945, 97310, 304, 2678, 82820, 13, 32602, 63508, 315, 9259, 8078, 11, 14689, 11, 706, 13019, 264, 19831, 21039, 430, 568, 574, 14219, 555, 7997, 8949, 6150, 11182, 364, 28753, 568, 16475, 34479, 33489, 11, 389, 813, 4443, 5690, 2199, 11, 389, 813, 1866, 892, 6, 32944, 449, 279, 7397, 11, 63508, 482, 889, 374, 264, 30249, 1389, 1047, 1101, 8621, 264, 1984, 4160, 10332, 813, 1862, 369, 10099, 3268, 13, 364, 2170, 4423, 889, 14264, 709, 8430, 46679, 3021, 323, 1862, 11, 323, 1457, 439, 264, 2748, 889, 6835, 3021, 323, 1862, 11, 358, 8007, 279, 3802, 430, 50545, 24869, 505, 21955, 27698, 311, 4933, 1124, 25181, 304, 15039, 649, 3596, 387, 6646, 82126, 2965, 568, 6267, 389, 279, 1772, 13, 63508, 574, 3309, 555, 813, 74133, 430, 279, 3070, 430, 25241, 420, 8961, 1047, 2663, 323, 35070, 922, 433, 323, 1071, 814, 1051, 23268, 323, 60178, 555, 279, 1772, 13, 364, 791, 2144, 430, 872, 3070, 596, 8961, 574, 304, 279, 6945, 11, 358, 8101, 11, 374, 1405, 872, 12458, 574, 5108, 505, 323, 505, 1148, 358, 574, 3309, 11, 814, 1051, 63757, 11, 16984, 430, 4423, 2643, 2586, 323, 1464, 872, 65643, 82820, 477, 1949, 872, 46266, 323, 872, 2911, 1051, 539, 6220, 311, 387, 704, 304, 872, 14006, 2965, 568, 3309, 13585, 220, 23, 13, 364, 16397, 279, 6574, 449, 856, 74133, 11, 358, 574, 16369, 584, 3974, 304, 264, 3544, 29149, 3158, 11, 902, 374, 837, 11, 323, 430, 264, 2763, 315, 1057, 3300, 369, 279, 8853, 4131, 1555, 11062, 315, 279, 4029, 323, 430, 358, 4460, 311, 387, 1633, 16994, 315, 1148, 602, 2231, 389, 320, 21124, 8, 1606, 358, 2643, 85086, 279, 4029, 323, 279, 7100, 12034, 315, 279, 4029, 2965, 1071, 63508, 13, 10771, 311, 264, 19831, 11, 2978, 38212, 3309, 1461, 568, 813, 5226, 8434, 956, 387, 36646, 1606, 315, 7397, 568, 1047, 8621, 2930, 9204, 8945, 97310, 304, 2678, 82820, 320, 13787, 6685, 8, 364, 40, 574, 1101, 3309, 430, 358, 1436, 617, 904, 4443, 21463, 358, 1390, 311, 617, 11, 719, 422, 358, 1390, 311, 387, 264, 3831, 63215, 29115, 11, 358, 2643, 1390, 311, 1427, 1139, 3815, 2555, 1023, 1109, 12917, 3238, 578, 19831, 2795, 279, 8925, 315, 11930, 315, 7997, 8949, 6150, 11182, 706, 264, 4947, 430, 13639, 4250, 6604, 922, 4819, 422, 3697, 315, 279, 4029, 29395, 449, 872, 6325, 13, 63508, 323, 279, 3778, 16803, 92586, 9323, 11, 902, 13019, 279, 19831, 389, 813, 17981, 11, 2019, 279, 4947, 374, 53925, 323, 527, 70507, 279, 9474, 311, 4148, 433, 13, 2435, 527, 1101, 10371, 369, 1203, 2343, 323, 26186, 323, 311, 15601, 2513, 1461, 1139, 813, 2362, 2361, 11, 1524, 3582, 568, 574, 22163, 520, 264, 6278, 2978, 304, 279, 9474, 304, 6186, 382, 19791, 25], prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

The duo had chemistry and the result was one of those seasons that will be hard to beat, with the Englishman scoring 27 goals in 32 games and winning the league's golden boot. Doing it again might be a lot tougher. Henry, the French international who brought immense talent and recognition to the league, has retired and Wright-Phillips is going to have to go through an adjustment period. Bradley Wright-Phillips (left) didn't have a shot in the Red Bulls' season opener against Sporting Kansas City. Thierry Henry retired at the end of the season meaning Wright-Phillips has a new strike partner. The Red Bulls have revamped their roster and Henry isn't the only one gone. Australian international Tim Cahill has departed along with fellow midfielder Eric Alexander. In the season opening tie against Sporting Kansas City, Wright-Phillips didn't have a shot. 'I don't have to readjust my game,' the 30-year-old Englishman said after the Red Bulls practiced for their home opener against D.C. United on Sunday. 'I am always going to play the same way I always have. The players that have come in, I'm trying to learn like I did with Thierry. I learned how he played and I learned to play off him. I'll try to do the same with the new guys.' The additions this season are midfielders Sacha Kljestan and Felipe Martins and striker Mike Grella. But in the 1-1 season-opening draw, the chemistry was lacking up front. 'On the day of the game I put a lot of it down to me,' Wright-Phillips said. 'I was a bit too eager to get behind. I could have done a little bit better with my runs. It's the first game, I don't really lose my mind after a first game of the season.' If there is a difference this season it's the style of the Red Bulls' play under new coach Jesse Marsch. There is an emphasis on moving the ball quickly with everybody contributing. A lot went through Henry in past seasons. The New York Red Bulls drew 1-1 with Sporting Kansas City in their first MLS game of the season. 'For us, it was almost a little unrealistic having a guy like Thierry on the team,' Red Bulls captain and midfielder Dax McCarty said. 'He was a little of a wild card, a joker. If you are losing or in a bad situation, you could just play him the ball and hope that something magical happened, which more often than not did. That's gone. I think this is a team that can hurt you in numerous ways and that's going to be a big shift this season. McCarty said the team could have helped Wright-Phillips more in the opening game. 'We didn't create enough chances for Bradley,' McCarty said. 'I think he will admit he can do a better job making better runs and we have a do a better job of looking for him and finding him when he does make those good runs. That is the thing that is going to make us successful this season. Wright-Phillips isn't heading into the season thinking: how does he top last year? He has set a goal target that he is not disclosing. If he meets it, he'll set another one. Whatever he does, Wright-Phillips isn't interested in heading back to England, where he played for Manchester City, Southampton, Plymouth Argyle, Charlton Athletic and Brentford before coming to the Red Bulls in July 2013. 'I don't want to go back to Europe. I've said that several times,' Wright-Phillips said. 'There were one or two whispers that I heard about but it doesn't interest me. I'm playing for the New York Red Bulls and I love living in New Jersey.' Wright-Phillips says he has no desire of coming back to England and is enjoying life in the USA.\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0,

According to media representatives in Tikrit, the Shiite militias chanted slogans as they stood over the ISIS fighters body in the back of the pick-up truck. The photographs emerged as it was revealed the US-led coalition would begin offering air support to the Iraqi Army and their allied Iran-supported Shiite militias at the request of Iraq's government. The unnamed official refused to say whether the air support extended to airstrikes and bombing raids on Islamic State targets in central Iraq. The U.S. has previously said the Iraqi government did not ask them to participate in the campaign. This morning the foreign ministers of Syria and Iraq met in the Syrian capital Damascus to discuss ways to tackle militant groups operating in their countries. Iraq also called for greater international cooperation to combat the violence, Syrian state TV said. Removal: Members of the Iraqi security forces take the dead body of an Islamic State fighter for burial after overnight clashes in Tikrit, 80 miles north of the capital Baghdad. Taken away: According to media representatives in Tikrit, the Shiite militias chanted slogans as they stood over the ISIS fighters body in the back of the pick-up truck. Iraq's Shiite-led government in Baghdad, together with Iran and the Lebanese group Hezbollah, have been important allies for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Shiite militias have fought on Assad's side against the insurgency spearheaded by Sunni Islamists. Iraq's armed forces are also the main partner on the ground for a U.S.-led coalition bombing Islamic State militants in Iraq but Washington and other Western governments have dismissed the idea of cooperating directly with Syria in the same fight. This morning's high-level discussions 'focused on the fight against terrorism and common dangers that threaten our countries,' Syrian state television said, citing a joint news conference by the foreign ministers at Damascus airport. It did not specify which groups the discussions were referring to. Talks: This morning the foreign minister of Syria, Walid al-Moallem (left), and the foreign minister of Iraq, Ibrahim al-Jaafari (right), met in the Syrian capital of Damascus to discuss ways to tackle militant groups. United: This morning's high-level discussions between the foreign ministers of Syria and Iraq 'focused on the fight against terrorism and common dangers that threaten our countries,' Syrian state television said. Iraq has acted as a go-between for information about the U.S.-led strikes on ISIS in both countries. Iraq's Foreign Minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari is also due to meet Assad himself, Jaafari's office said today. Jaafari's visit comes ahead of an Arab League meeting in Egypt scheduled for the weekend. Syria's seat has been left vacant since its membership was suspended in November 2011 after the government's crackdown on protests. 'Terrorism is not just a danger that faces both countries but one that will affect all countries if there is not cooperation,' Jaafari said, according to Syria's state news channel. His Syrian counterpart Walid al-Moualem said the two countries'stand in the same trench against terrorism,' state news agency SANA said. In September Iraq's national security adviser briefed Assad on efforts to counter Islamic State, in the first such meeting since the United States launched air strikes on the group in Iraq. Territory held by Islamic State in Syria includes most of Deir al-Zor province, which borders Iraq.\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0,

Please output the summary only, without any other text.\n\nArticle:\nPort Vila, Vanuatu (CNN)Tropical Cyclone Pam had already been battering Vanuatu\'s capital for hours when the River Prima suddenly flooded its banks. A wall of water and mud surged through Sam Upan\'s house, toppling the walls of the neighboring church where he serves as a deacon. It was midnight on Friday, and he had no choice but to wade out into the gale force wind and darkness. "The water was up to my waist!" he says. Upan eventually made it to higher ground, taking shelter on a parked van.  Fortunately, he had sent his family away before the storm to a shelter in the center of the capital, Port Vila. But on Monday, three days after the storm struck, Upan and his daughters sit in the debris strewn rubble of their home. On Sunday, he built a temporary shack for them to sleep under.  A bundle of bananas donated by a friend lies nearby in the mud. It\'s the only food the family has to eat. Nearby, Upan\'s daughter Elsie slowly scrubs mud out of a shirt. Other families all across this tropical town are facing similar difficulties in the aftermath of the storm. To many Westerners, Vanuatu is a holiday destination boasting crystal blue waters and luxury yachts. But it\'s also one of the poorest nations in the Pacific, and many of its 260,000 inhabitants live in flimsy houses built of thatch or metal sheets. Those vulnerable homes were dealt a fearsome blow over the weekend by Cyclone Pam, one of the strongest storms ever to make landfall. The aid group Oxfam is warning that the cyclone may have caused "one of the worst disasters ever seen in the Pacific." The storm rampaged across Vanuatu\'s sprawling archipelago of more than 80 islands on Friday and Saturday, wielding 155 mph (250 kph) winds. About 65 islands in the archipelago are inhabited. The full extent of the devastation remained unclear Monday. With communication lines to many of the outer islands cut, it could take days or even weeks to emerge. Eleven people have so far been confirmed dead, according to Vanuatu authorities said. But the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said the toll was expected to rise. The agency said 3,300 people were taking shelter in 37 evacuation centers. How to help Vanuatu residents. Vanuatu President Baldwin Lonsdale told CNN the destruction was the worst his country had ever experienced, describing the storm as "a monster." He said it would take the developing nation "a couple of years" to get back to where it was before Pam struck. In the capital, Port Vila, residents were still reeling from the storm\'s impact. Thousands of people have been left homeless and many who rely on subsistence farming to get by have seen their main source of food wiped out. Most people live on root crops, said Jonathan Napat, a ranking natural disaster official. "What the people depend on entirely is just wiped out." He was overwhelmed by the dimension of the food loss. "Just unbearable. Just too much to contain," he said. A CNN team that arrived in the capital Monday saw more than 100 people taking refuge in church. In one valley, trees were snapped in two or stripped of leaves. Many residents said it was the worst storm that they can remember. And that\'s in a Pacific nation that\'s regularly hit by cyclones. Officials say Cyclone Pam destroyed or badly damaged 90% of the houses in Port Vila, as well as flooding parts of the hospital and trashing schools and churches. There were some small signs of progress around the capital. A lack of electricity and running water hasn\'t stopped residents from starting the hard work of clearing away fallen trees and branches, as well as the corrugated metal roofing that Pam ripped off thousands of buildings. The sound of chainsaws and handsaws can be heard throughout the shell-shocked community. The main airport is back in business, allowing military aircraft from Australia and New Zealand to bring in aid workers and supplies. The first commercial flight since the storm landed Monday. But the big unknown remains the scale of the destruction the huge storm wrought on the outer islands to the north and south of the capital. "It\'s certainly deeply concerning because those islands down there were incredibly hard hit," said Tom Perry, a spokesman for the aid organization CARE International. Many people now lack the basics of life: clean water, food and shelter. "Homes have been lost, crops are destroyed. The damage is enormous, and people need our help," said Aurelia Balpe, head of the Red Cross in the Pacific. "Yet it will still take some time before we really understand the full extent of the damage." Some 60,000 children are in need of assistance, UNICEF reported Sunday. Vanuatu has officially declared a state of emergency, opening the door for other countries to help. The country\'s remote location adds to the challenges facing the international response. Port Vila is more than 1,770 kilometers (1,100 miles) northeast of Brisbane on Australia\'s east coast, and some 2,200 kilometers north of Auckland, the closest city in New Zealand. CNN\'s Ivan Watson reported from Port Vila, and Jethro Mullen reported and wrote from Hong Kong. CNN\'s Pamela Boykoff, Kristie LuStout, Madison Park and Lynda Kinkade contributed to this report.\n\nSummary:', params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0,

Please output the summary only, without any other text.\n\nArticle:\nBayern Munich will be without winger Arjen Robben for several weeks after he suffered a stomach muscle tear in the shock 2-0 defeat to Borussia Monchengladbach on Sunday. Robben, who has only recently returned from a back injury, was taken off after just 24 minutes following a challenge from Gladbach's Tony Jantschke. The Dutchman could now be a doubt for Bayern's Champions League quarter-final first leg against Porto on April 15 with the club saying he would be out 'for several weeks.' Arjen Robben tore a stomach muscle in Bayern Munich's loss to Borussia Monchengladbach. Robben had only just returned from a back injury but now faces an absence of several weeks. Robben heads down the tunnel in the 24th minute after going off injured for Munich. 'His injury is almost as bad as the defeat,' said Bayern Munich CEO Karl-Heinz Rummenigge. The winger, who missed last week's win over Werder Bremen and was a surprise inclusion in the starting line-up on Sunday, is the league's second-top scorer with 17 goals this term. Deespite suffering their first home defeat of the season, Bayern are still 10 points clear at the top of the Bundesliga. 'They barely got into our half before they scored their first goal and it's not easy to break down a side who pack their defence,' said Bayern boss Pep Guardiola. Munich boss Pep Guardiola bemoaned his team's first defeat at home in the Bundesliga this season. Manuel Neuer (centre) spills a shot from Raffael as Bayen Munich lost to Borussia Monchengladbach. Monchengladbach's players celebrate their win after the final whistle with supporters. 'We failed to break down their defence and they counter-attacked superbly, but we did all we could. We still have a 10-point lead, but we must fight until the end to defend our title. 'We still have eight games left and we have the chance now to regroup during the international break.'\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=128, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=False, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: [128000, 9370, 5730, 553, 279, 2768, 3754, 4652, 304, 220, 4386, 11460, 13, 5321, 2612, 279, 12399, 1193, 11, 2085, 904, 1023, 1495, 382, 17064, 512, 23407, 944, 47304, 690, 387, 2085, 74539, 1676, 24041, 4997, 8123, 369, 3892, 5672, 1306, 568, 16654, 264, 23152, 16124, 18036, 304, 279, 10988, 220, 17, 12, 15, 18506, 311, 23768, 29578, 3206, 68284, 18599, 35638, 389, 7418, 13, 4997, 8123, 11, 889, 706, 1193, 6051, 6052, 505, 264, 1203, 11134, 11, 574, 4529, 1022, 1306, 1120, 220, 1187, 4520, 2768, 264, 8815, 505, 52741, 35638, 596, 19036, 622, 1821, 331, 441, 13, 578, 24113, 1543, 1436, 1457, 387, 264, 10712, 369, 56691, 596, 29908, 9130, 8502, 55962, 1176, 2531, 2403, 70798, 389, 5936, 220, 868, 449, 279, 6469, 5605, 568, 1053, 387, 704, 364, 2000, 3892, 5672, 3238, 1676, 24041, 4997, 8123, 63108, 264, 23152, 16124, 304, 56691, 47304, 596, 4814, 311, 23768, 29578, 3206, 68284, 18599, 35638, 13, 4997, 8123, 1047, 1193, 1120, 6052, 505, 264, 1203, 11134, 719, 1457, 12580, 459, 19821, 315, 3892, 5672, 13, 4997, 8123, 14971, 1523, 279, 26711, 304, 279, 220, 1187, 339, 9568, 1306, 2133, 1022, 15902, 369, 47304, 13, 364, 16366, 11134, 374, 4661, 439, 3958, 439, 279, 18506, 2965, 1071, 56691, 47304, 12432, 35131, 12, 1548, 41622, 46332, 5794, 343, 713, 13, 578, 74539, 11, 889, 13942, 1566, 2046, 596, 3243, 927, 36880, 1126, 426, 62969, 323, 574, 264, 13051, 28286, 304, 279, 6041, 1584, 5352, 389, 7418, 11, 374, 279, 10966, 596, 2132, 8338, 64769, 449, 220, 1114, 9021, 420, 4751, 13, 1611, 288, 6100, 16066, 872, 1176, 2162, 18506, 315, 279, 3280, 11, 56691, 527, 2103, 220, 605, 3585, 2867, 520, 279, 1948, 315, 279, 85903, 13, 364, 7009, 20025, 2751, 1139, 1057, 4376, 1603, 814, 16957, 872, 1176, 5915, 323, 433, 596, 539, 4228, 311, 1464, 1523, 264, 3185, 889, 3854, 872, 23682, 2965, 1071, 56691, 13697, 54086, 12542, 81539, 13, 47304, 13697, 54086, 12542, 81539, 293, 6868, 52530, 813, 2128, 596, 1176, 18506, 520, 2162, 304, 279, 85903, 420, 3280, 13, 44681, 4275, 8977, 320, 75217, 8, 84051, 264, 6689, 505, 432, 2715, 6015, 439, 9332, 268, 47304, 5675, 311, 23768, 29578, 3206, 68284, 18599, 35638, 13, 3206, 68284, 18599, 35638, 596, 4311, 18890, 872, 3243, 1306, 279, 1620, 40649, 449, 15879, 13, 364, 1687, 4745, 311, 1464, 1523, 872, 23682, 323, 814, 5663, 12, 1617, 11440, 33689, 398, 11, 719, 584, 1550, 682, 584, 1436, 13, 1226, 2103, 617, 264, 220, 605, 16983, 3063, 11, 719, 584, 2011, 4465, 3156, 279, 842, 311, 10726, 1057, 2316, 13, 364, 1687, 2103, 617, 8223, 3953, 2163, 323, 584, 617, 279, 6140, 1457, 311, 1239, 896, 2391, 279, 6625, 1464, 22438, 19791, 25], prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

Such gas giants, as far as we know, are not hospitable to life, but now it has been suggested that the moons of these planets could be habitable. If confirmed, it would suggest these locations could be the predominant sources for life in the universe, not worlds like our own Earth. The idea was discussed by Dr Sarah Ballard of the University of Washington in Seattle, on the Public Radio International's (PRI) show The Takeaway. Scroll down for audio. Dr Sarah Ballard of the University of Washington was speaking to PRI. She said exomoons could be the 'predominant sites of life in the universe'. Shown is an illustration of Upsilon Andromedae d, the large world in the distance, orbiting the gas giant in the foreground, which could have habitable moons. She explained how Jupiter-sized planets in the habitable zones of stars - where conditions are ideal for water, and perhaps life - are more common than single rocky worlds like Earth. Hot exomoons. Too close to a star and an exomoon may have an average temperature above the boiling point of water, making it highly unsuitable for any form of life. Habitable exomoons. Exoplanets orbiting in a system’s habitable zone (where liquid water can persist on a planet’s surface) still need sufficient gravity to trap an atmosphere that regulates their temperature. If these conditions are met, however, the prospects for life are promising. Snowball exomoons. Moons formed in the outer reaches of an alien solar system are likely to be dominated by ice. They will remain deep-frozen unless heated by tides from their parent planet - again these are unlikely to be habitats for life. Transient exomoons. Moons of planets with elliptical orbits might be habitable for most of their planet’s year, but can experience hot or snowball periods as they venture too close to their star, or too far from its life-giving heat. Source: All About Space magazine. ‘If even some of these Jupiter-sized planets have moons, they might be the predominant sites of life in the universe,’ she said. In particular, she focused on the world of Upsilon Andromedae d, a gas giant exoplanet about 10 times the mass of Jupiter, located 44 light-years from Earth. While the planet itself is not thought to be habitable, it is possible that a moon in its orbit - known as an exomoon - could be. And if you were to step on the surface of the moon, you would see ‘beautiful tumultuous clouds on the Jovian planet’ and ‘incredibly complex cloud activity,’ according to Dr Ballard. So far, no exomoons have been discovered, but given that six of the eight planets in our solar system have moons, most astronomers regard it as an inevitability rather than a possibility that one will be found. It might be possible to find one in data collected by Nasa’s Kepler space telescope, or it may be necessary to wait for a more powerful planet-hunter to come online, such as the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (Tess), due to launch in 2017. Finding exomoons is a bit of a problem though, as their mass and size is so much less than their host planet. One technique to find them that may prove successful is gravitational microlensing, which uses a foreground star to magnify a more distant one. The chance alignment can reveal exoplanets around a star, and could possibly even be used to spot a moon in orbit. So far, no exomoon has been discovered, but given that six of the eight planets in our solar system have moons, most astronomers regard it as an inevitability rather than a possibility that one will be found. It might be possible to find one in data collected by Nasa’s Kepler space telescope (illustration shown) And we are able to rule certain planets out - ones that are too close to their host star, like Mercury and Venus in our own solar system, are unable to cling on to natural satellites. But finding out if moons are common in our galaxy will be key for the search for life, and could signal a change in goals for planet-hunters in the near future. ‘The fact we reside on a single rocky hunk of rock, orbiting without a big brother planet, might be relatively unusual,’ added Dr Ballard. One technique to find moons could be gravitational microlensing, which uses a foreground star to magnify a more distant one, as shown in this diagram. The chance alignment can reveal exoplanets around a star, and could possibly even be used to spot a moon in orbit.\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0,

An eight-year-old girl has been left eating through a syringe after she was attacked by a springer spaniel that tore a centimetre off her lip and bit through her cheek. Annie Ramsay was walking with her friends  near her home in Whittle-le-Woods, Lancashire, on Thursday when she bent down to stroke the dog as it made its way out of a park with its owner. Her friend stroked the animal first before Annie did the same but the spaniel, which was known to her, licked her face then sank its teeth into her cheek - puncturing her. She ran back home with blood pouring down her face screaming \'I\'m going to die\' as her horrified father, John, 47, called for an ambulance. Annie was rushed to hospital and underwent plastic surgery, where doctors used the inside or her lip to rebuild the part that had been torn off. She spent three days being treated before she was allowed back home on Sunday, where she is still recovering. The attack has left her unable to eat and her mother Rebecca Ramsay, 34, has to blend her food and feed it to her through a straw or with a syringe. Mrs Ramsay, who has two older sons, Steven, 14, and Josh, 12, said: \'I was heartbroken when I saw her. It\'s just awful. \'She was petrified but she\'s been so brave and we\'re really proud of her. She\'s a huge dog lover and so sweet with animals so it was a big shock to her. \'The first day after the attack we couldn\'t even mention the word "dog" around her - she was hysterical. \'But I\'ve been trying to explain to her that you get good dogs and bad dogs because I don\'t want her to be frightened of them but at the same time part of me never wants her to go near one again.\' The schoolgirl had bent down to stroke the dog when it sunk its teeth into her cheek and tore a centimetre of skin from her lip. SHe was rushed to hospital and underwent plastic surgery to fix the damage. The family was struck by tragedy in 2011 when Annie\'s older brother, Dylan, drowned while swimming in a quarry near their home. \'Since his death I have been campaigning around schools about safety and that\'s where I was at when Annie was attacked,\' said Mrs Ramsay. Annie, who has since returned home to recover, is likely to have a hairline scar as a result of the attack. \'She had been out playing with friends and the owner, who she knows and lives on our road, was coming out of the park and she stroked it like she has done several times before. \'It liked her face and that\'s when it bit into her cheek and took about a centimetre off her lip. She ran home screaming and my husband shouted for a neighbour to call the ambulance. \'Her brothers were terrified, especially after losing Dylan so recently, about what would happen to their sister. \'I rushed to the hospital as soon as I heard and I couldn\'t believe it when I saw her. But the doctors are hopeful and we have to share their enthusiasm that she will be okay.\' Annie is recovering at home and was even strong enough to make it to a party on Sunday where she met \'Olaf\' from Frozen. \'She\'s in a lot of pain and on lots of antibiotics but she\'s in really good spirits,\' she added. It\'s likely she will be left with a hairline scar on her face, but her eye is expected to return fully to normal. Lancashire Constabulary confirmed that a warrant under the dangerous dogs act was executed and the dog seized. It remains in kennels and an investigation is under way, which will involve speaking to the victim any witnesses and the dog\'s owner. Mrs Ramsay, whose own dog - a Staffie cross - died recently, said: \'The police are carrying out interviews and will need to speak to Annie in-depth before anything is done. \'There were lots of witnesses too so I think they need to speak to them as well. We\'re not sure what is going to happen to the dog but it should be put down after what it\'s done to my daughter.\'\n\nSummary:', params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0,

Zaur Dadayev told two members of Russia\'s human rights council that he pleaded guilty after being detained because he was scared. He told Eva Merkacheva and Andrey Babushkin he had been tortured and the well-being of his family and friends were threatened. Dadayev was one of two suspects recently charged in the case. Three other suspects have not been charged. Merkacheva and Babushkin were accused of "interfering" with the investigation and will be summoned for questioning over their motives, authorities said. Russia\'s Investigative Committee stated that the two rights activists violated the law when they visited and questioned Dadayev in a Moscow jail. Amnesty International condemned the Russian officials\' decision to go after the activists, saying that a "threat to bring criminal charges" against the rights activists "raises alarming questions over the fairness of the investigation." Anton Tsvetkov, the head of the Public Chamber\'s commission for public security, said Dadyev and two other suspects denied being involved in the shooting of the Russian opposition leader. He said a doctor found no signs of torture during an examination of the three men. Shagit Gubashev and Anzor Gubashev had no bruises or wounds despite the fact they allege they were beaten by police, Tsvetkov said. Dadayev did have a cracked tooth and handcuff marks on his wrists. Nemtsov, one of President Vladimir Putin\'s most outspoken critics, was shot in the back on a Moscow bridge as he walked with his girlfriend near the Kremlin in February 27. The three suspects visited by Tsvetkov deny they are guilty and have appealed their arrests, he said. Putin has condemned Nemtsov\'s killing and ordered three law enforcement agencies to investigate, the Kremlin has said. He also wrote to Nemtsov\'s mother, saying he shared her grief, and promised to bring those behind the killing to justice. CNN\'s Matthew Chance and Alla Eshchenko reported from Moscow, and Steve Almasy wrote from Atlanta. CNN\'s Elwyn Lopez and Karen Smith contributed to this report.\n\nSummary:', params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=128, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=False, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: [128000, 9370, 5730, 553, 279, 2768, 3754, 4652, 304, 220, 4386, 11460, 13, 5321, 2612, 279, 12399, 1193, 11, 2085, 904, 1023, 1495, 382, 17064, 512, 77406, 19457, 320, 56555, 8, 791, 6156, 15562, 55606, 304, 3717, 449, 279, 10658, 4648, 315, 52771, 63268, 83, 85393, 62765, 813, 58473, 8079, 11, 5605, 568, 1047, 1027, 1234, 3930, 676, 2391, 813, 26360, 323, 4536, 956, 16390, 13, 1901, 4202, 33621, 352, 5230, 3309, 1403, 3697, 315, 8524, 596, 3823, 3268, 15177, 430, 568, 40001, 16390, 1306, 1694, 37993, 1606, 568, 574, 27207, 13, 1283, 3309, 55492, 108227, 1815, 6723, 323, 1628, 8233, 26441, 1136, 8148, 568, 1047, 1027, 57034, 323, 279, 1664, 33851, 315, 813, 3070, 323, 4885, 1051, 21699, 13, 33621, 352, 5230, 574, 832, 315, 1403, 30861, 6051, 11684, 304, 279, 1162, 13, 14853, 1023, 30861, 617, 539, 1027, 11684, 13, 108227, 1815, 6723, 323, 26441, 1136, 8148, 1051, 13487, 315, 330, 2295, 809, 287, 1, 449, 279, 8990, 323, 690, 387, 52810, 369, 34685, 927, 872, 52140, 11, 11527, 1071, 13, 8524, 596, 33180, 1413, 10554, 11224, 430, 279, 1403, 3268, 21572, 34521, 279, 2383, 994, 814, 12263, 323, 29440, 33621, 352, 5230, 304, 264, 23223, 17999, 13, 78796, 7327, 39025, 279, 8690, 7510, 6, 5597, 311, 733, 1306, 279, 21572, 11, 5605, 430, 264, 330, 97229, 311, 4546, 9337, 10405, 1, 2403, 279, 3268, 21572, 330, 33371, 57376, 4860, 927, 279, 51841, 315, 279, 8990, 1210, 17958, 350, 3576, 295, 52767, 11, 279, 2010, 315, 279, 3142, 32479, 596, 12396, 369, 586, 4868, 11, 1071, 423, 7759, 5230, 323, 1403, 1023, 30861, 15164, 1694, 6532, 304, 279, 10658, 315, 279, 8690, 14076, 7808, 13, 1283, 1071, 264, 10896, 1766, 912, 12195, 315, 30667, 2391, 459, 24481, 315, 279, 2380, 3026, 13, 1443, 74972, 480, 392, 300, 81913, 323, 1556, 89, 269, 480, 392, 300, 81913, 1047, 912, 98675, 477, 34254, 8994, 279, 2144, 814, 83717, 814, 1051, 31394, 555, 4379, 11, 350, 3576, 295, 52767, 1071, 13, 33621, 352, 5230, 1550, 617, 264, 43939, 26588, 323, 66145, 1386, 15785, 389, 813, 86878, 13, 63268, 83, 85393, 11, 832, 315, 4900, 36011, 21810, 596, 1455, 70379, 23531, 11, 574, 6689, 304, 279, 1203, 389, 264, 23223, 14497, 439, 568, 15203, 449, 813, 23601, 3221, 279, 51424, 304, 7552, 220, 1544, 13, 578, 2380, 30861, 12263, 555, 350, 3576, 295, 52767, 23973, 814, 527, 16390, 323, 617, 53382, 872, 38811, 11, 568, 1071, 13, 21810, 706, 39025, 63268, 83, 85393, 596, 13419, 323, 11713, 2380, 2383, 13627, 13607, 311, 19874, 11, 279, 51424, 706, 1071, 13, 1283, 1101, 6267, 311, 63268, 83, 85393, 596, 6691, 11, 5605, 568, 6222, 1077, 38384, 11, 323, 19487, 311, 4546, 1884, 4920, 279, 13419, 311, 12437, 13, 20352, 596, 19475, 40034, 323, 91733, 469, 939, 7674, 9509, 5068, 505, 23223, 11, 323, 14129, 1708, 76, 6539, 6267, 505, 20005, 13, 20352, 596, 4072, 54756, 45315, 323, 35745, 9259, 20162, 311, 420, 1934, 382, 19791, 25], prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

The world champion was replying to Red Bull team principal Christian Horner, who called on the FIA to limit the superiority of Hamilton’s Mercedes team to make the season a more even fight. Horner’s view was supported on Monday by Bernie Ecclestone, the sport’s commercial boss, who said: ‘Red Bull are 100 per cent right. Lewis Hamilton celebrates his Australian Grand Prix win after he finished ahead of team-mate Nico Rosberg. The British Formula One star appeared in good spirits as he was pictured at Sydney Airport on Monday. ‘There is a rule I think (former FIA president) Max Mosley put in that in the event of a particular team or engine supplier doing something magic, which Mercedes have done, the FIA can level up things. Mercedes have done a first-class job. We need to change things a little bit now. ‘What we should have done was frozen the Mercedes engine and leave everybody else to do what they want so they could have caught up. We should support the FIA to make changes.’ The indications  were that the FIA, the sport’s rule-makers, will not rush to act on Ecclestone’s words, which may have been intended primarily to soothe Red Bull, whose motorsport adviser Helmut Marko said they might walk away in light of rules that ‘will kill the sport’. Hamilton, celebrating his 34th career victory in Melbourne, detected an irony in Red Bull’s criticism. Also on the podium was Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel who, as a Red Bull driver, won four consecutive championships from 2010. On Sunday it was third-placed Vettel’s turn to finish more than half a minute behind Hamilton and his Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg. Hamilton and Rosberg finished more than half-a-minute ahead of third-placed Sebastian Vettel on Sunday. Hamilton sprays champagne after winning the opening race of the year; his seventh win from the last eight. VIDEO Hamilton cruises to victory in Australian GP. Hamilton said: ‘I was sitting next to Sebastian after the race and I said: “Sebastian, you did this for four years. You were 30 seconds ahead. So I know how it must have felt back then.” ‘He had nobody behind pushing him. At least I’ve got my team-mate, who I was really racing. I don’t remember that ever being the case with Red Bull.’ Ouch, even though Mark Webber did sometimes push Vettel, and not all of the German’s championships were comfortable, with his first title coming down to a four-way decider in Abu Dhabi. Hamilton added: ‘If you want to put someone in the same car, there is no doubt where I would be finishing. People say it’s all the car. Well, it’s a big team that built this car. I’m the one who has to get in and extract the best from it. There has never been a driver that has won the championship that hasn’t had a great car that year. There’s nobody who had a Marussia and won the world championship, is there? Fangio still had a great car.’ Former Red Bull racer Mark Webber interviews his old boss Christian Horner ahead of Sunday's race. Horner's Red Bull have threatened to withdraw from the sport if changes are not implemented. Hamilton’s views will be shared by those who believe Mercedes should be allowed to reap the rewards for their hard work, but Red Bull’s Marko said: ‘We will evaluate the situation again in the summer. If we are totally dissatisfied, we could contemplate an F1 exit. ‘Yes, the danger is there that Mr Mateschitz (the owner) loses his passion for F1.’ Meanwhile, Ecclestone has said Manor must pay for not putting out a car in Melbourne. The team, who blamed software problems for not turning a wheel, believed they had met the terms of their contract and would collect £28million in prize money by turning up in Australia. But Ecclestone said: ‘They had no intention of racing. Zero.’ 1. Lewis Hamilton (Britain) Mercedes 1:31:54.067. 2. Nico Rosberg (Germany) Mercedes +00:01.360. 3.

Clark McClelland was allegedly part of a team based at the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida, when he spotted the extra-terrestrial humanoid. The 'entity', he says, stood on two legs and approached two U.S. astronauts, that he would not name, for one minute and seven seconds in the space shuttle bay. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO. Sighting? Clark McClelland, allegedly pictured during his time with NASA, claims he saw a nine-foot alien. The entity, he claims in a YouTube video, was standing on two legs and interacted with two US astronauts. His story has been hailed by supporters as the most conclusive evidence that intelligent life exists in space. McClelland claims the U.S. government has stripped him of his pension and forced him to live on social security, despite insisting he has served on more than 800 NASA missions. But in a series of YouTube videos, he implores the public to take him seriously. 'I love my planet, I love our human race. I'm trying to serve all of you, if only you will let me,' he tells viewers. Video: Stargate Chronicles. Getting his story out: McClelland has posted pictures from his time with NASA but claims nobody believes him. History: This is allegedly a picture of McClelland (left) with\xa0Judy Resnick (right), America's second female astronaut who died in 1986 when her Challenger shuttle broke apart 73 seconds into flight. After more than 800 missions with NASA, he says, he has no pension and lives off social security. McClelland's Twitter profile features a picture billed as his younger self in NASA uniform. In a picture on his website he poses with NASA astronauts by a space shuttle. Another shows a beaming McClelland allegedly stood with Judy Resnick, America's second female astronaut who died in 1986 when her Challenger shuttle broke apart 73 seconds into flight.\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=128, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=False, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: [128000, 9370, 5730, 553, 279, 2768, 3754, 4652, 304, 220, 4386, 11460, 13, 5321, 2612, 279, 12399, 1193, 11, 2085, 904, 1023, 1495, 382, 17064, 512, 32, 4846, 22146, 24490, 8349, 568, 5602, 264, 11888, 21117, 20167, 1418, 16967, 264, 3634, 9131, 304, 220, 2550, 16, 13, 22010, 14583, 273, 74512, 574, 19755, 961, 315, 264, 2128, 3196, 520, 279, 24573, 11746, 5955, 304, 29715, 3053, 402, 3333, 11, 9784, 11, 994, 568, 30652, 279, 5066, 12, 466, 53686, 93209, 13, 578, 364, 3069, 518, 568, 2795, 11, 14980, 389, 1403, 14535, 323, 25735, 1403, 549, 815, 13, 69522, 11, 430, 568, 1053, 539, 836, 11, 369, 832, 9568, 323, 8254, 6622, 304, 279, 3634, 45641, 23542, 13, 7683, 23081, 28594, 4716, 42869, 13, 328, 45850, 30, 22010, 14583, 273, 74512, 11, 19755, 42666, 2391, 813, 892, 449, 22146, 11, 8349, 568, 5602, 264, 11888, 21117, 20167, 13, 578, 5502, 11, 568, 8349, 304, 264, 13674, 2835, 11, 574, 11509, 389, 1403, 14535, 323, 16681, 291, 449, 1403, 2326, 69522, 13, 5414, 3446, 706, 1027, 64895, 555, 15879, 439, 279, 1455, 98586, 6029, 430, 25530, 2324, 6866, 304, 3634, 13, 14583, 273, 74512, 8349, 279, 549, 815, 13, 3109, 706, 37779, 1461, 315, 813, 28781, 323, 9770, 1461, 311, 3974, 389, 3674, 4868, 11, 8994, 60727, 568, 706, 10434, 389, 810, 1109, 220, 4728, 22146, 25664, 13, 2030, 304, 264, 4101, 315, 13674, 6946, 11, 568, 3242, 385, 417, 279, 586, 311, 1935, 1461, 14243, 13, 364, 40, 3021, 856, 11841, 11, 358, 3021, 1057, 3823, 7102, 13, 358, 2846, 4560, 311, 8854, 682, 315, 499, 11, 422, 1193, 499, 690, 1095, 757, 2965, 568, 10975, 22511, 13, 8519, 25, 800, 867, 349, 66416, 13, 25531, 813, 3446, 704, 25, 14583, 273, 74512, 706, 8621, 9364, 505, 813, 892, 449, 22146, 719, 8349, 19093, 13919, 1461, 13, 11346, 25, 1115, 374, 19755, 264, 6945, 315, 14583, 273, 74512, 320, 2414, 8, 449, 4194, 41, 18339, 1838, 21035, 320, 1315, 705, 5270, 596, 2132, 8954, 47733, 889, 8636, 304, 220, 3753, 21, 994, 1077, 87583, 45641, 14760, 10980, 220, 5958, 6622, 1139, 11213, 13, 4740, 810, 1109, 220, 4728, 25664, 449, 22146, 11, 568, 2795, 11, 568, 706, 912, 28781, 323, 6439, 1022, 3674, 4868, 13, 14583, 273, 74512, 596, 6405, 5643, 4519, 264, 6945, 50546, 439, 813, 14992, 659, 304, 22146, 14113, 13, 763, 264, 6945, 389, 813, 3997, 568, 34103, 449, 22146, 69522, 555, 264, 3634, 45641, 13, 13596, 5039, 264, 387, 6605, 14583, 273, 74512, 19755, 14980, 449, 55158, 1838, 21035, 11, 5270, 596, 2132, 8954, 47733, 889, 8636, 304, 220, 3753, 21, 994, 1077, 87583, 45641, 14760, 10980, 220, 5958, 6622, 1139, 11213, 382, 19791, 25], prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

Please output the summary only, without any other text.\n\nArticle:\nFloyd Mayweather's superfight against Manny Pacquiao on May 2 is to be conducted under the US Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) testing program. The welterweight rivals have agreed that their Las Vegas showdown will observe the rules established under the World Anti-Doping Code (Code), the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) Prohibited List and the USADA Protocol for Olympic and Paralympic Movement Testing. Both fighters have agreed to unannounced blood and urine testing without reservation and will be tested out of competition prior to the fight and in competition after the fight. Floyd Mayweather Jnr posted pictures to his social media ahead of mega-fight with Manny Pacquiao on May 2. Some of the banned substances that will be tested for at the WADA-accredited laboratory are growth hormone (HGH), erythropoietin (EPO) and the use of carbon isotope ratio (CIR). 'It's a strong statement of the importance of clean and safe competition to have these two fighters voluntarily agree to have a WADA level anti-doping program implemented for this fight,' said USADA chief executive Travis Tygart. 'We commend them for their stance on clean sport and the message it sends to all those who want to compete clean at the highest levels of all sport.' Mayweather vs Pacquiao is widely considered to be one of the biggest boxing fights of all-time. Mayweather and Pacquiao are set to earn hundreds of millions from the blockbuster fight. Plans for the pair to clash five years ago when at the peak of their powers were abandoned after Pacquiao refused to participate in blood testing at Mayweather's insistence. The two went head to head for the first and only time prior to their collision at the MGM Grand at a press conference in Los Angeles on Wednesday. No publicity tour has been scheduled and they will not meet again until fight week. The showdown is set to be the richest in boxing history, with an estimated shared purse of 250,000,000 US dollars (£167.4million). Mayweather, 38, is coming to the end of a brilliant, and as yet unbeaten, professional boxing career.\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=128, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=False, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: [128000, 9370, 5730, 553, 279, 2768, 3754, 4652, 304, 220, 4386, 11460, 13, 5321, 2612, 279, 12399, 1193, 11, 2085, 904, 1023, 1495, 382, 17064, 512, 37, 26881, 98434, 596, 2307, 21828, 2403, 95255, 12925, 447, 23332, 389, 3297, 220, 17, 374, 311, 387, 13375, 1234, 279, 2326, 23853, 9607, 34807, 16784, 320, 2078, 33393, 8, 7649, 2068, 13, 578, 12724, 466, 4870, 35938, 617, 7378, 430, 872, 16132, 18059, 72708, 690, 23846, 279, 5718, 9749, 1234, 279, 4435, 23853, 9607, 34807, 6247, 320, 2123, 705, 279, 4435, 23853, 9607, 34807, 16784, 320, 54, 33393, 8, 1322, 93617, 1796, 323, 279, 2326, 33393, 25590, 369, 25944, 323, 4366, 5893, 1331, 292, 29098, 27866, 13, 11995, 24080, 617, 7378, 311, 653, 1036, 20018, 6680, 323, 40335, 7649, 2085, 28767, 323, 690, 387, 12793, 704, 315, 10937, 4972, 311, 279, 4465, 323, 304, 10937, 1306, 279, 4465, 13, 46899, 98434, 622, 20191, 8621, 9364, 311, 813, 3674, 3772, 8469, 315, 40487, 2269, 492, 449, 95255, 12925, 447, 23332, 389, 3297, 220, 17, 13, 4427, 315, 279, 21501, 33155, 430, 690, 387, 12793, 369, 520, 279, 468, 33393, 38698, 67309, 27692, 527, 6650, 36908, 320, 39, 45776, 705, 89357, 98643, 78, 3978, 258, 320, 36, 2089, 8, 323, 279, 1005, 315, 12782, 374, 51782, 11595, 320, 34, 2871, 570, 364, 2181, 596, 264, 3831, 5224, 315, 279, 12939, 315, 4335, 323, 6220, 10937, 311, 617, 1521, 1403, 24080, 54523, 7655, 311, 617, 264, 468, 33393, 2237, 7294, 1773, 34807, 2068, 11798, 369, 420, 4465, 2965, 1071, 2326, 33393, 10388, 11145, 41810, 14221, 46346, 13, 364, 1687, 74212, 1124, 369, 872, 30031, 389, 4335, 10775, 323, 279, 1984, 433, 22014, 311, 682, 1884, 889, 1390, 311, 20874, 4335, 520, 279, 8592, 5990, 315, 682, 10775, 3238, 98434, 6296, 12925, 447, 23332, 374, 13882, 6646, 311, 387, 832, 315, 279, 8706, 46329, 28533, 315, 682, 7394, 13, 98434, 323, 12925, 447, 23332, 527, 743, 311, 7380, 11758, 315, 11990, 505, 279, 72097, 4465, 13, 35695, 369, 279, 6857, 311, 41003, 4330, 1667, 4227, 994, 520, 279, 16557, 315, 872, 13736, 1051, 23838, 1306, 12925, 447, 23332, 16436, 311, 16136, 304, 6680, 7649, 520, 98434, 596, 79397, 13, 578, 1403, 4024, 2010, 311, 2010, 369, 279, 1176, 323, 1193, 892, 4972, 311, 872, 19277, 520, 279, 99491, 10517, 520, 264, 3577, 10017, 304, 9853, 12167, 389, 8079, 13, 2360, 43763, 7364, 706, 1027, 13847, 323, 814, 690, 539, 3449, 1578, 3156, 4465, 2046, 13, 578, 72708, 374, 743, 311, 387, 279, 57471, 304, 46329, 3925, 11, 449, 459, 13240, 6222, 53101, 315, 220, 5154, 11, 931, 11, 931, 2326, 11441, 54915, 11515, 13, 19, 59413, 570, 98434, 11, 220, 1987, 11, 374, 5108, 311, 279, 842, 315, 264, 20333, 11, 323, 439, 3686, 66671, 13827, 11, 6721, 46329, 7076, 382, 19791, 25], prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

Family members identified the slain Fulton County officer as 48-year-old Terence Avery Green, who had been with the department for 22 years, WSBTV reported. He was shot in the back of the head as he and other officers responded to reports of a man firing shots near Fairburn at 12.43am. Another officer was shot in the belt area but the bullet hit his radio, leaving him unharmed. The suspect, 42-year-old Amanuel Menghesha, was shot by other officers  and was taken to Grady Memorial Hospital, where he is being treated. His condition is unknown. Scroll down for video. Shot dead:\xa0Terence Avery Green, pictured left, was shot in the back of the head on Wednesday morning. Local reports identified his shooter as Amanuel Menghesha, 42, pictured right in an earlier mug shot. Scene: Fulton County Lieutenance B. Hicks stands guard at the home on Parks Trail where the suspect lived. The shooting unfolded after officers headed to the Cedar Grove neighborhood early on Wednesday after a 911 call made from inside the suspect's home reported that he was firing shots. Neighbors said was going from house to house and banging on doors and firing a long barrel gun,\xa011alive reported. When police arrived on the scene, they began searching the foggy streets for Menghesha, who had left his home. As they searched, he began shooting at the officers, police said. Fulton County Assistant Police Chief Gary Stiles said the officers were forced to act in dark and foggy conditions. 'They were trying to do their job, they were trying to protect this neighborhood from someone who was shooting,' he told reporters at the scene. 'And they had no other option but to do their job. And the way it appears to me, they were ambushed without warning.' Tragic: The police officer was shot dead on this road in Fulton County after he was ambushed by the suspect. The officers had responded to calls that the suspect was banging on neighbors' doors and firing shots. One of the officers was struck in the back of the head. He was rushed to Grady Memorial Hospital, where he was pronounced dead shortly after 4.30am. 'This is not the first officer we have lost, and the men and women who work for this department are going to be heartbroken,' Stiles said. The officers responded with their own fire and hit the suspect. He was alert and conscious when he was transported to hospital, the Atlanta Journal Constitution reported. Another officer was shot in the belt area but was saved when his radio was struck instead and shattered,\xa0WSBTV reported. He did not require any medical attention. The station reported that the Menghesha was known to the police. They had previously responded to reports that he was intoxicated. Earlier records show he had been arrested for theft and for domestic violence incidents. Employment records show he was in the Army. Shock: Speaking from the scene, Fulton County Assistant Police Chief Gary Stiles said the officers were working in dark and foggy conditions when they were ambushed without warning. On the scene: Authorities continue to investigate the scene of the shooting near Fairburn, Georgia. Stiles said they do not believe there are any other suspects in the case and that the weapon has been recovered from the scene. Alfred Printup, who lives in the neighborhood, was at work but on the phone to his wife and could hear the gunshots ring out. 'I just want to thank that police officer who gave his life to keep my family safe,' he told 11alive. The police department and Georgia Bureau of Investigation continue to investigate. According to the Fulton County Police Department's website, the slain officer is its first officer killed in the line of duty since April 2003.

Please output the summary only, without any other text.\n\nArticle:\nA retired teacher knocked his wife out with a dumbbell and then slit her throat in a'mercy killing' at their £390,000 home because he couldn't cope with her dementia, a court heard. John Colin Bennett, 75, killed his wife Beatrice, 75, at their North Shropshire home after struggling to come to terms with her debilitating condition. His devoted wife of 55 years had been left unable to recognise her husband as a result of Alzheimer's disease and regularly called him a 'double' or an 'imposter'. John Colin Bennett, 75, killed his wife Beatrice, 75, at their £390,000 North Shropshire home (pictured) In May last year Mr Bennett decided he wanted to 'end her pain' and severely struck his wife with several blows to the head with a dumbbell fracturing her skull. He then cut her throat with a kitchen knife before calmly calling 999 and telling operators: 'I've done a terrible thing, I have murdered my wife.' The pensioner was detained in a psychiatric clinic under the Mental Health Act yesterday after previously admitting manslaughter at Stafford Crown Court. Judge Simon Tonking said: 'This wasn't a premeditated killing. It was, in part, an act which you believed to be one of mercy.' The court was told the happily married couple, both retired teachers, were completely devoted to one another but were unable to have children. They were described as a very 'private couple' who lived in Market Drayton, Shropshire, and relied on one another for almost everything. He then cut her throat with a kitchen knife before calmly calling 999 and telling operators: 'I've done a terrible thing, I have murdered my wife' The pair had a 'happy and active' retirement until Mrs Bennett, known as Trixi, began to show signs of dementia in 2011. Prosecutor Deborah Gould said: 'She was an enthusiastic bridge player and her condition first became noticeable whilst she was playing. 'Mr Bennett became plagued with fears about their future, he became depressed, unable to sleep and was on sleeping tablets. 'What undermined the world of this couple was age.' When he dialled 999 to hand himself in, he said: 'She has Alzheimer's. I hit her on the head to stun her. 'I couldn't see her suffer any more so I put an end to it. 'She didn't recognise me as her husband. I have had two years living with this stress.' Michael Duck QC, for the defence, said: 'That which emerges most strikingly is the depth of affection between husband and wife, the way they had supported each other as individuals for five and a half decades. 'On any view, a happy married life. He is contrite in the extreme. The pressures brought to bear on that particular day came together in a tragic few moments.' Speaking at the time of the death neighbours of the couple in the picturesque market town expressed shock at the news. Local resident Paul Dawson, 48, said: 'Trixie was very ill. I can't believe it was murder, he was probably trying to help her die. 'It's just not possible, somewhere like this. I'm just gob-smacked.'

They clearly feel he is the cream of their crop and are talking 2016 Gold Cup. But he shows so much speed, at this stage I would favour his RSA Chase-winning stablemate Don Poli for that race ahead of him. Vautour and Ruby Walsh romp home to a 15-length victory in the JLT Novices' Chase. Trainer Willie Mullins (bottom right) and Walsh have the 2016 Gold Cup in mind for Vautour. Darna gave jockey David Bass a first Festival win in the Brown Advisory and Merriebell Stable Plate and underlined the resurgence of trainer Kim Bailey. It is 20 years since Bailey landed the Champion Hurdle and Gold Cup double with Alderbrook and Master Oats. David Bass cheers after Darna gave him a first Festival win in the\xa0Brown Advisory and Merriebell Stable Plate. Martin still on the ball. A second win at the meeting for trainer David Pipe, courtesy of The Package in the Fulke Walwyn Kim Muir Challenge Cup, had his father and my old boss, Martin, buzzing. ‘It was a certainty,’ he gleefully told me after he won under Irish amateur jockey Jamie Codd. It goes to show that Martin might be retired but his competitive instinct burns as strong as ever.

The military is now focused on recovering the helicopter, which searchers found at the bottom of the Santa Rosa Sound near Eglin Air Force Base, and the bodies of all seven Marines and four Louisiana Army National Guard members who were aboard, Air Force Col. Monte Cannon said. Also ahead: Trying to determine why the aircraft went down in thick fog during a training mission Tuesday, Cannon said. "The decision to suspend is always difficult," said Layne Carter, search and rescue mission coordinator of the U.S. Coast Guard. "With heavy hearts, we have decided to suspend active search and rescue operations. Our thoughts and prayers are with the friends and family of the members involved in this tragedy." The bodies of at least two National Guard members were recovered Thursday, and the remains of the other two were believed to be in the underwater wreckage 25 feet below the surface, the Guard said. The troops were with 1-244th Assault Helicopter Battalion from Hammond, Louisiana, according to a statement from the Louisiana National Guard. The military had previously said that some remains had washed ashore Wednesday. Military officials declined to say Thursday how many bodies still were missing, and they did not release the names of the service members involved in the crash. Two Black Hawk helicopters were training near Eglin in heavy fog when one of them went down in the sound -- a narrow body of water between mainland northern Florida and a barrier island -- about 8:30 p.m. Tuesday, the military has said. A couple of military boats already were in the water for safety purposes as part of the exercise, but "nobody saw anything because of the dense fog," said Mark Giuliano, chief of the Eglin Air Force Base\'s fire department. "People said they heard a loud bang, and that was it," Giuliano said Thursday. The second Black Hawk -- which, like the first, was assigned to the 1-244th Assault Helicopter Battalion based in Hammond, Louisiana -- safely returned to the base, some 40 miles east of Pensacola. "Whatever the trouble was with the one aircraft, it did not involve the second helicopter that was participating in the exercise," Eglin spokesman Andy Bourland said earlier this week. Giuliano said his fire department, which has a unit on Santa Rosa Island near the crash site, was called to help at about 10 p.m. Tuesday, roughly 90 minutes after the crash. The military boats that were part of the mission already had been searching for survivors and wreckage, he said. Investigators from the Army and the Marines will try to determine what caused the wreck, Cannon said Thursday. Military officials have said it\'s too early to know whether the fog contributed to the crash. The 11 service members, all men, were involved in a seven-day training exercise of amphibious operations, said Capt. Barry Morris, a spokesman for the U.S. Marines Corps Special Operations Command. It involved small boats, and inserting and extracting Marines from the water via helicopter. Morris would not say which phase of the training the Marines were in Tuesday night. The seven Marines were with a Marine Special Operations regiment out of Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. The initial search was hampered by dense fog, to the point that searchers on boats "could not see," Giuliano said. On Wednesday morning, after searchers got a sonar hit, a diver found the bulk of the wreck at the bottom of the sound, Giuliano said. Divers then went into the water "to start retrieving the aircrew," Giuliano said, without specifying how many bodies were recovered. The helicopter had broken into several pieces in a "high-impact crash," he said. The Coast Guard has hired a salvage company from Mobile, Alabama, to take the wreckage from the water, but that company might not arrive until Thursday evening, and weather conditions may delay the recovery until Friday, Giuliano said. Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, expressed his condolences on Wednesday. He said the crash was "a reminder to us that those who serve put themselves at risk, both in training and in combat." "We will work with the services to ensure that... their family members will be well cared for." A Marine died Wednesday when a T-59 Hawk, an aircraft operated by a civilian contractor, crashed at Marine Corps Air Station Yuma, Arizona. The aircraft hit a government vehicle, killing the Marine.  The pilot and passenger of the plane were examined and released by emergency services.

Please output the summary only, without any other text.\n\nArticle:\nThe photographs show Kerrie  Cartmill gazing down at her tiny newborn son, who is nuzzled into her chest. Though little bigger than a bag of sugar and surrounded by tubes and wires, he is sleeping peacefully. But while the picture is one of serenity, the pictures marked a frightening time for Mrs Cartmill and her husband Stuart. Their son's health was deteriorating rapidly, and they knew these precious days could be the only time they would ever have with their him. Kerrie and Stuart Cartmill are seen (left and right) cradling their newborn son Matthew to their chests. He was born with a rare condition which sees 90 per cent of babies die within the first five days of their lives. Matthew was born with Trisomy 13, a rare chromosomal disorder which cause multiple congenital abnormalities which result in severe physical and mental impairment. Matthew, from Newry, Northern Ireland, suffers from a rare condition called Trisomy 13, which sees 90 per cent of babies die within the first five days of their lives. Incredibly, Matthew beat the odds and has lived to see his first birthday, a milestone doctors feared he might never reach. Trisomy 13 is a chromosomal disorder which can lead to multiple congenital abnormalities which result in severe physical and mental impairment. It affects only one in 16,000 births, and it is so rare that Matthew is currently the only person in Northern Ireland with the condition. In the first year of his life, he spent 170 days in hospital and has had medical appointments every day. His family have committed themselves to caring for their only child and Mrs Cartmill, 29, gave up her job as a primary school teacher to care for her son. She said: 'We've all had such a tough year and Matthew has spent nearly half of his life in hospital. But we are now looking to give him more stability and a routine at home. Trisomy 13, or Patau syndrom, is a chromosomal abnormality caused by an extra copy of chromosome 13 in every cell. The condition causes multiple congenital abnormalities which result in severe physical and mental impairment. It occurs in  one in 16,000 live births and is the third most common autosomal trisomy in newborns. A couple are more at risk of having a child with the condition if they have a family history of the condition, risk also rises with maternal age. Many babies with Trisomy 13 are stillborn or die within the first few days after being born - the life expectancy of affected babies is just 2.5 days. About 50 per cent of babies survive for longer than a week and only five to ten per cent survive for longer than a year. Features of the condition include, low birth weight, heart defects, facial defects, severe learning difficulties, problems controlling breathing, deafness, hernias, polycystic kidneys and abnormal hands and feet. 'Our plans as a family have changed as we give Matthew every bit of our time and energy. We don't know what the future holds, we just take every day as it comes.' During the pregnancy, Mr and Mrs Cartmill refused genetic testing because of the risk of miscarriage - and say they\xa0knew that whatever happened, it would not have changed their minds about going ahead with the pregnancy. Immediately after Matthew was born, five weeks early by an emergency Caesarean, doctors knew something was wrong. He was sent for genetic testing when he was two days old, and three weeks later the family found out he had Trisomy 13. Mrs Cartmill said: 'We were terrified when we got the results back as doctors didn’t really explain what it meant for Matthew.' They explained that Trisomy, which is also known as Patau syndrome, is caused by an extra copy of chromosome 13 in every cell. The condition affects the heart, brain, spinal cord, eyes and muscles and causes the sufferer numerous physical abnormalities as well as severe intellectual disabilities. For the first year of his life, Matthew saw paediatricians, neurologists and dietitians almost every day. He still has daily appointments which can sometimes be with a specialist, or for physiotherapy,  speech therapy or sensory play. He is currently on a respiratory monitor to check his breathing, and is taking medication for seizures, iron deficiency and acid reflux. He also suffers from a defect to his optic nerve, which causes problems with his vision, and he has regular eye appointments. The family have just celebrated Matthew's first birthday, a milestone doctors feared he would never reach. Matthew's parents say their son, who has sensory and developmental delays, as well as problems with his vision, is growing in strength. His parents have started fundraising for sensory toys to aid his development. But despite his ongoing medical problems, he  is one of only 5 to 10 per cent of children with the condition to live past their first year. The condition is so rare doctors do not know what the prognosis will be for the future, but stress that the disease is severely disabling. But Mr and Mrs Cartmill are determined to prove everyone wrong, and say Matthew is growing in strength all the time. She said: 'He's our superstar. He is developing his own personality now and is so much fun to be around. 'Now Matthew has reached one we just want to cut down the travelling round the country and give Matthew a better quality of life.' Matthew still has daily appointments for physiotherapy, speech therapy or sensory play. The family have been overwhelmed by the outpouring of love and support from the community and have started fundraising for sensory toys to aid his development. They are hoping the toys will add much needed normality to Matthew's life and give him something to look forward to. Mrs Cartmill said: 'Our consultant is happy that he is stable at the moment and has given us the go ahead to be more physical with him. 'We have stepped up Matthew's physio and are already seeing positive signs. 'We hope to have sensory toys so that Matthew can enjoy play like every other baby.'

Amber Dlaine McKinney Morgan, 25, was heading north on the I-805 in San Diego at around 1am on Friday when she fell asleep at the wheel. California Highway Patrol arrived at the scene to get into the vehicle, but when the woman woke she took her foot off the brake, and the car started to roll. Extraordinary footage captured by ABC 10 shows the officer running alongside the vehicle shouting'stop, stop' at the woman before smashing the glass on the passenger side. He then opes the door and turns the emergency brake on to stop it from moving any further. When officers searched the car, they allegedly found a bottle of liquor and a collection of other drinks. They arrested McKinney Morgan on suspicion of drunk driving. She was booked into LCDRF Las Colinas Detention and Reentry Facility in Santee, California, and is being held on $250 bail. The authorities were forced to close several lanes on the highway to avoid other motorists hitting the stopped car or their officers who were on the road dealing with the situation. Footage shows the officer running alongside the car shouting 'Stop, stop' before smashing the glass. He then opens the door and turns the emergency brake on.

The excellent P&O Heritage website offers fascinating glimpses of life on board - all tea dances and cucumber sandwiches. What a change there is today. The bow of Britannia carries a huge stylised Union Jack, which serves not merely as a clever national marketing device, but broadcasts a British heritage which has been brought bang up to date. You feel that the latest P&O vessel Britannia, which the Queen officially named last Monday in Southampton, could fit the Oronsay on to one deck. However, they are not just vessels from different eras - they come from wholly dissimilar philosophies. Oronsay was built primarily to get passengers from Tilbury to Sydney - fun was considered to be a fancy dress party or the odd beetle drive. Britannia has been purposefully built for enjoyment. It is an entertainment monster, bristling with fun on almost every deck. It is, to borrow a line from poetry, a stately pleasure dome. It's customary to bemoan the compromised standards of the modern era, to yearn for the sturdier certainties of times past. Cruising, at least, is one area where newer almost always means better. P&O Cruises may be part of the American Carnival corporation these days but, happily, it remains British to the tips of its mastheads. The bow of Britannia carries a huge stylised Union Jack, which serves not merely as a clever national marketing device, but broadcasts a British heritage which has been brought bang up to date. The ambassadors for modern P&O Cruises are chefs such as Marco Pierre White, Atul Kochar and James Martin because it is in the area of food, strangely enough, in which the UK has begun to lead the world. Another area where we set the standard is in hotels: the international success of Nick Jones and his Soho House group has ushered in a new era of laid-back elegance. It is this very style that Britannia has captured so impressively. The modern era of British cruising, which P&O Cruises began with the Oriana more than 20 years ago, has now achieved an apotheosis with Britannia. For those poor holiday limpets who will not consider cruising because they refuse to acknowledge the emergence of what is arguably the purest form of holidaymaking, I have one piece of advice: be ruled by Britannia because Britannia really does rule the waves.\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=128, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=False, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: [128000, 9370, 5730, 553, 279, 2768, 3754, 4652, 304, 220, 4386, 11460, 13, 5321, 2612, 279, 12399, 1193, 11, 2085, 904, 1023, 1495, 382, 17064, 512, 4599, 279, 16657, 14943, 2954, 311, 279, 44721, 304, 220, 6280, 17, 11, 279, 5652, 3245, 304, 8448, 2955, 574, 279, 62574, 7228, 596, 507, 26692, 352, 11, 264, 220, 16, 11, 2636, 48067, 10214, 27274, 5918, 555, 650, 40189, 6830, 8892, 4620, 520, 1202, 20085, 304, 4821, 654, 3502, 7424, 399, 434, 13, 578, 9250, 393, 5, 46, 34243, 3997, 6209, 27387, 94162, 288, 315, 2324, 389, 4580, 482, 682, 15600, 73806, 323, 66032, 57758, 13, 3639, 264, 2349, 1070, 374, 3432, 13, 578, 15631, 315, 98520, 689, 24266, 264, 6908, 49304, 4147, 9323, 7762, 11, 902, 17482, 539, 16632, 439, 264, 28799, 5426, 8661, 3756, 11, 719, 66198, 264, 8013, 28948, 902, 706, 1027, 7263, 26518, 709, 311, 2457, 13, 1472, 2733, 430, 279, 5652, 393, 5, 46, 27274, 98520, 689, 11, 902, 279, 16657, 19073, 7086, 1566, 7159, 304, 62251, 11, 1436, 5052, 279, 507, 26692, 352, 389, 311, 832, 9722, 13, 4452, 11, 814, 527, 539, 1120, 31080, 505, 2204, 2781, 300, 482, 814, 2586, 505, 42241, 14091, 79962, 13868, 552, 13, 507, 26692, 352, 574, 5918, 15871, 311, 636, 22961, 505, 58769, 20176, 311, 21972, 482, 2523, 574, 6646, 311, 387, 264, 27555, 8679, 4717, 477, 279, 10535, 98486, 6678, 13, 98520, 689, 706, 1027, 7580, 3725, 5918, 369, 45278, 13, 1102, 374, 459, 16924, 18118, 11, 1437, 380, 2785, 449, 2523, 389, 4661, 1475, 9722, 13, 1102, 374, 11, 311, 17636, 264, 1584, 505, 32349, 11, 264, 357, 2718, 17069, 58438, 13, 1102, 596, 73348, 311, 293, 6868, 276, 279, 44500, 10886, 315, 279, 6617, 11639, 11, 311, 1060, 77, 369, 279, 357, 16468, 1291, 2847, 62124, 315, 3115, 3347, 13, 14761, 3876, 11, 520, 3325, 11, 374, 832, 3158, 1405, 26627, 4661, 2744, 3445, 2731, 13, 393, 5, 46, 14761, 5014, 1253, 387, 961, 315, 279, 3778, 78844, 27767, 1521, 2919, 719, 11, 37875, 11, 433, 8625, 8013, 311, 279, 10631, 315, 1202, 19218, 36910, 13, 578, 15631, 315, 98520, 689, 24266, 264, 6908, 49304, 4147, 9323, 7762, 11, 902, 17482, 539, 16632, 439, 264, 28799, 5426, 8661, 3756, 11, 719, 66198, 264, 8013, 28948, 902, 706, 1027, 7263, 26518, 709, 311, 2457, 13, 578, 96662, 369, 6617, 393, 5, 46, 14761, 5014, 527, 60227, 1778, 439, 35281, 38077, 5929, 11, 2468, 360, 30417, 1799, 323, 7957, 11826, 1606, 433, 374, 304, 279, 3158, 315, 3691, 11, 70706, 3403, 11, 304, 902, 279, 6560, 706, 22088, 311, 3063, 279, 1917, 13, 13596, 3158, 1405, 584, 743, 279, 5410, 374, 304, 25325, 25, 279, 6625, 2450, 315, 15341, 12201, 323, 813, 2100, 6292, 4783, 1912, 706, 64260, 291, 304, 264, 502, 11639, 315, 17551, 15825, 64543, 13, 1102, 374, 420, 1633, 1742, 430, 98520, 689, 706, 17439, 779, 10098, 3210, 13, 578, 6617, 11639, 315, 8013, 73327, 11, 902, 393, 5, 46, 14761, 5014, 6137, 449, 279, 38998, 3444, 810, 1109, 220, 508, 1667, 4227, 11, 706, 1457, 17427, 459, 73990, 1820, 10934, 449, 98520, 689, 13, 1789, 1884, 8009, 13560, 4671, 65301, 889, 690, 539, 2980, 73327, 1606, 814, 26122, 311, 25670, 279, 49179, 315, 1148, 374, 36659, 279, 10748, 267, 1376, 315, 13560, 28936, 11, 358, 617, 832, 6710, 315, 9650, 25, 387, 21989, 555, 98520, 689, 1606, 98520, 689, 2216, 1587, 6037, 279, 17301, 382, 19791, 25], prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

Please output the summary only, without any other text.\n\nArticle:\nRenault, which supplies engines to the Red Bull and Toro Rosso teams, is considering pulling out of Formula One because of the damage done to its reputation after a difficult start to the season. Renault Sport F1 managing director Cyril Abiteboul said Friday he is looking at his options, 'including getting out of Formula One.' 'If Formula One is that bad for Renault's reputation, if we see that we will continue to struggle with the current formula, if Formula One is not delivering on the value that it costs Renault... this is what we're looking at,' he said. Renault's Cyril Abiteboul (centre) is pictured at a press conference in Kuala Lumpur on Friday. However, Abiteboul was also asked whether Renault was weighing up the option of buying an existing F1 team and becoming a race constructor again. 'We'll have to review the situation from a marketing and strategic perspective,' Abiteboul said. Renault won championships in 2005 and 2006 but withdrew from the sport after heavy penalties for fixing the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix. The team principal of Toro Rosso, which is considered to be a takeover target if Renault took that step, said the Italy-based team would be receptive to an offer from Renault. 'This would be a fantastic opportunity for Toro Rosso to make the next step forward,' Franz Tost said. 'To be part of a manufacturer, to work together with a manufacturer, and be owned by a manufacturer would be exactly the step the team needs.' Red Bull driver Daniel Ricciardo in action during the first practice session for the Malaysian Grand Prix. Two other teams considered to be possible targets for Renault are Force India and Lotus, which have had financial troubles, but both played down any interest. Both teams have engine supply deals with Mercedes through 2020. 'We are not looking for a buyer and are not for sale,' Lotus chief executive Matthew Carter said. Force India deputy principal Bob Fernley said: 'I have had absolutely no discussion at all with Renault.' If Renault pulls out of F1, or switches from engine supplier to competitor, it would put Red Bull in a difficult situation. Toro Rosso's Max Verstappen drives during Friday's practice at the Sepang International Circuit. Red Bull team principal Christian Horner said such a change may leave the Austrian-based parent company with no option but to withdraw from the sport, too, because there would be no other viable option for engine supply. 'It sound like Franz wants to sell his team to Cyril and we will then need an engine,' Horner said. 'Should we find ourselves in a situation without an engine supplier... you could find yourself actually forced out of the sport.' Red Bull and Horner have expressed frustration with the lack of cost control in the sport, and he referenced that again Friday. Abiteboul (left) sits alongside Red Bull team principal Christian Horner at a press conference on Friday. 'Is Formula One delivering for Red Bull as a brand? There are some worrying signs,' Horner said. 'Red Bull wants to be in Formula One and we want to try and address some of the issues that are currently plaguing the sport that we don't seem to be able to find any traction with.' Horner also said Red Bull has no plans to start making its own engines - a theory fueled by the team's new deal with engineering group Ilmor. 'We have no intention of being an engine manufacturer,' Horner said. 'We (Red Bull and Ilmor) are trying to work in co-ordination with Renault to assist in the areas where perhaps they are not strong.'\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0,

A supply teacher tried to pester two teenager schoolgirls into a threesome despite being warned about his flirty behaviour by colleagues, a court heard. James Heathcote, 26, a former sports coach, was employed by St Helena School in Colchester, Essex, after being sacked from his previous job when a female colleague accused him of sexually harassment. While there he groomed two besotted pupils and pestered them to fulfill his fantasy of having a threesome. The supply teacher even exposed himself to the pair over a webcam as he traded explicit messages referring to bondage and strip tease fantasies. He was only caught when a fellow pupil reported the explicit messages before he could convince the impressionable girls to go through with his plan. Heathcote, from Felixstowe, Suffolk, fought back tears in the dock at Chelmsford Crown Court yesterday\xa0as he was jailed for five months. He was also ordered to sign the sexual offenders register for seven years. Heathcote admitted two charges of inciting two girls to engage in sexual activity whilst in a position of trust  but denied a third charge of sexual touching, involving allegedly kissing a pupil, which will now lie on file. As he passed sentence Judge David Turner QC said: 'Young women in school are entitled to be protected - even from themselves. 'You were the subject of some attention from female pupils and you may have found that flattering, but you should not have acted on it. 'You exchanged messages that were plainly, openly and explicitly sexual. 'You made references to bed, sex, intercourse, tying up and 'banging'. 'The sexual nature of these messages is unmistakable. 'You had asked for a 'threesome' with the young women, which they refused. 'It needs to be understood that people in a school setting owe a duty of care to the young people in their charge. 'You have fallen far short in that duty.' Heathcote joined the school as a part-time supply teacher in Spring 2013 before taking up a full time role in September 2013 and moving into a house on school property. His flirty nature with pupils was noted by colleagues who warned him to discourage his young female admirers. He ignored the advice before swapping phone numbers with two female schoolgirls in October 2013 when they complained about struggling with exam stress. A judge said Heathcote had 'fallen far short' of his duty  when he groomed the two besotted teenagers. The messages soon spread onto social media sites, including Instagram and Facebook, where the exchanges became sexual in nature as he begged the girls to share intimate pictures. On one occasion he even exposed himself to both girls  whilst chatting to them on FaceTime as they sat in their nightwear. Allan Compton, prosecuting, said: 'Police went through some of the Facebook messages to one girl which did contain significant sexual content. 'The messages described fantasies about being tied up, strip tease, as well as fantasies about having a threesome.' By January 2014, Heathcote had suggested a threesome to both girls and bombarded one with a staggering 242 text messages over a seven day period. Both had admitted during the exchanges that they would have sex with him separately but refused his request of a threesome. The explicit messaging only ended when a fellow pupil reported her suspicions and police were called in. Heathcote joined St Helena School, Chelmsford, pictured, as a part-time supply teacher in Spring 2013. Heathcote was arrested and contacted both girls asking them to delete all messages in a failed bid to cover his tracks. Mr Compton added: 'The aggravating features of this offending include the use of grooming behaviour and the soliciting of sexual images from the girls. 'There is, within the last text, an element of cover up when he invites them to delete text messages. 'It would appear that arrangements had been put in place to escalate to full sexual activity but, thankfully, it did not.' The court heard how Heathcote had been dismissed from a previous role as a school sports coach in October 2012 following an allegation of sexual harassment from an adult female work colleague. Peter Barlex, mitigating, said his client had been working as a cover supervisor at the school full-time since September 2013. He said: 'This was a situation that got out of hand. 'It is something he bitterly regrets ever getting involved in. 'This was a profession he had really set his sights upon but which has now gone.' Heathcote was jailed for five months and was made to sign onto the sex offenders register for seven years. He was also made the subject of a 10-year sexual harm prevention order banning him from unsupervised contact with under 18s without a guardian's consent. St Helena School is a secondary school in Colchester, Essex, with more than 1,000 pupils. A spokesman for the school said: 'Mr Heathcote is no longer an employee of St Helena School, having been dismissed in July 2014. 'The safety and wellbeing of students is the school's top priority and the school followed all the correct and required procedures in its pre-employment checks. 'As soon as a safeguarding concern was raised, the school alerted the police and local authority immediately and suspended Mr Heathcote.'\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1,

The 30-year-old had requested a personal hearing after being charged with using abusive and/or insulting words and/or behaviour towards a match official in or around the tunnel area after the final whistle following Albion's 2-0 FA Cup defeat to Aston Villa this month. Brunt is banned with immediate effect and will miss Saturday's Barclays Premier League trip to Manchester City. West Bromwich Albion midfielder has been handed a one match ban and an £8,000 fine by the FA. Brunt  argues with referee Anthony Taylor after he sends off Claudio Yacob during the game at Villa Park. The Northern Ireland international faced the threat of a two-game ban and Albion's director of football administration Richard Garlick believes the punishment reflected the circumstances in which the game finished. Villa fans invaded the pitch at the final whistle and had also run onto the surface while the game was still in play, with the invasions the subject of an FA investigation. Referee Anthony Taylor had also sent off Albion's Claudio Yacob and Villa's Jack Grealish towards the end of the match. Thousands streamed on to the pitch after the match, which helped make Brunt's an 'extraordinary case' 'We had a fair hearing and feel the punishment is an acknowledgement by the Commission that this was an extraordinary case,' said Garlick, after the Independent Regulatory Commission in London on Tuesday. 'It was a difficult end to the game for everyone and emotions were running high. 'I think Chris's disciplinary record, which has seen him issued with one red card in more than 400 appearances at the highest levels, was also rightly noted.'\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=128, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=False, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: [128000, 9370, 5730, 553, 279, 2768, 3754, 4652, 304, 220, 4386, 11460, 13, 5321, 2612, 279, 12399, 1193, 11, 2085, 904, 1023, 1495, 382, 17064, 512, 24188, 65698, 17316, 32672, 290, 45067, 11517, 3320, 3935, 706, 1027, 22340, 369, 832, 2489, 323, 54981, 7083, 23, 11, 931, 1306, 25694, 264, 21424, 10229, 41094, 6900, 13, 578, 220, 966, 4771, 6418, 1047, 11472, 264, 4443, 11011, 1306, 1694, 11684, 449, 1701, 43658, 323, 5255, 68192, 4339, 323, 5255, 17432, 7119, 264, 2489, 4033, 304, 477, 2212, 279, 26711, 3158, 1306, 279, 1620, 40649, 2768, 32672, 290, 596, 220, 17, 12, 15, 15358, 11098, 18506, 311, 66774, 37912, 420, 2305, 13, 3320, 3935, 374, 21501, 449, 14247, 2515, 323, 690, 3194, 7884, 596, 89845, 20210, 9130, 8577, 311, 19922, 4409, 13, 4410, 65698, 17316, 32672, 290, 45067, 706, 1027, 23415, 264, 832, 2489, 9120, 323, 459, 7083, 23, 11, 931, 7060, 555, 279, 15358, 13, 3320, 3935, 220, 29633, 449, 55302, 21353, 16844, 1306, 568, 22014, 1022, 2493, 17152, 816, 40051, 2391, 279, 1847, 520, 37912, 5657, 13, 578, 17355, 14990, 6625, 17011, 279, 6023, 315, 264, 1403, 19959, 9120, 323, 32672, 290, 596, 7690, 315, 9141, 8735, 12131, 12471, 1228, 13919, 279, 25060, 27000, 279, 13463, 304, 902, 279, 1847, 8220, 13, 37912, 7359, 64765, 279, 9846, 520, 279, 1620, 40649, 323, 1047, 1101, 1629, 8800, 279, 7479, 1418, 279, 1847, 574, 2103, 304, 1514, 11, 449, 279, 1558, 88771, 279, 3917, 315, 459, 15358, 8990, 13, 8718, 76060, 21353, 16844, 1047, 1101, 3288, 1022, 32672, 290, 596, 2493, 17152, 816, 40051, 323, 37912, 596, 7762, 480, 8110, 819, 7119, 279, 842, 315, 279, 2489, 13, 63294, 74345, 389, 311, 279, 9846, 1306, 279, 2489, 11, 902, 9087, 1304, 3320, 3935, 596, 459, 364, 15824, 21707, 1162, 6, 364, 1687, 1047, 264, 6762, 11011, 323, 2733, 279, 25060, 374, 459, 68023, 555, 279, 9849, 430, 420, 574, 459, 24674, 1162, 2965, 1071, 12471, 1228, 11, 1306, 279, 22765, 69822, 9849, 304, 7295, 389, 7742, 13, 364, 2181, 574, 264, 5107, 842, 311, 279, 1847, 369, 5127, 323, 21958, 1051, 4401, 1579, 13, 364, 40, 1781, 11517, 596, 57315, 3335, 11, 902, 706, 3970, 1461, 11136, 449, 832, 2579, 3786, 304, 810, 1109, 220, 3443, 27351, 520, 279, 8592, 5990, 11, 574, 1101, 54466, 10555, 22438, 19791, 25], prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

She arrived for class beaming with excitement about the journey she was about to begin -- participation in a yearlong academic theology program sponsored jointly by four Atlanta seminaries. Since she has been sentenced to the death penalty and lives in solitary confinement, Kelly was particularly eager to share community with others, if only one morning a week. And she was grateful for the opportunity to explore the Bible and theology in a rigorous manner that would nurture and deepen her devotional life. That image of her on the first day of class remains vivid to me because it captures the core of who Kelly is — who she has become: someone full of contagious joy and gratitude, open to others and to new experiences for growth and ministry. Kelly\'s process of transformation began shortly after she arrived in prison following her conviction for murder in the death of her husband, Doug Gissendaner. A pastor began visiting her and initiated a series of difficult, yet compassionate, conversations that urged her toward courageous self-reflection. This same pastor has been visiting Kelly for almost 16 years. Her commitment to Kelly, along with that of the prison chaplain and chaplaincy interns, provided steady, ongoing love that fostered change. So by the time I met Kelly in 2010 she had already undergone a significant transformation. She was, in the words of the Apostle Paul, a "new creation" (2 Cor. 5:17). In the theology program, Kelly found her own voice and came to see that her reflections on Christian faith could be a gift to the wider church "on the outside," as well as in prison. By studying historical and contemporary Christian thinkers, Kelly became part of the conversations that make the Christian tradition dynamic. She asked honest questions about her relationship to God, others and the world. She read scripture and grappled with centuries-old theological questions. She discovered her authentic theological voice in the midst of this work. "From the start of the theology class I felt this hunger," she said in her 2011 graduation speech. "I became so hungry for theology, and what all the classes had to offer; you could call me a glutton." One of the great joys of being a theology professor is getting to know students holistically, not only as thinkers, but also as human beings wrestling with some of life\'s most urgent questions. My relationship with Kelly had this quality from the start. But it deepened six months into the year when a new warden arrived at the prison. In her graduation speech, Kelly described this moment:. "There came a time when... my worst fears became my reality -- I was pulled from the courses. I was taken from my theological community. Being pulled from the program devastated me as badly as if someone had just told me one of my appeals had been turned down. "Since I couldn\'t go to the theology class... the instructors came to me. Still, this was far from being ideal because now I had to have class and community through a gate. It was hard... but I pushed on. I pushed on because of that hunger. That gate... was meant to keep everyone and everything separated from me. But that gate couldn\'t keep out the knowledge that I was so hungry for, nor friendship and community. And it sure couldn\'t keep out God." This change afforded us the chance to have two hours of one-on-one conversation every Friday. We continued to read theological texts together, including a book by then-Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams. Williams describes healing and restoration as the act of facing our painful memories, "the ruins of the past," and building from them here and now. Restoration, Williams writes, "is going back to the memories of the painful, humiliating past and bringing them to redemption in the present... to Christ [who] comes to repair the devastation." I sat with Kelly as she went back over some of her own painful memories, took responsibility for them and showed profound remorse about who she had been and what she had done. Indeed, the power of these moments -- when Kelly looked me in the eye and confessed concrete sins, when we spoke of God\'s love and forgiveness -- will stay with me forever. Kelly embraced what Dietrich Bonhoeffer, a German pastor-theologian and Nazi resister, calls "costly grace." For Bonhoeffer, "cheap grace" is seeking God\'s forgiveness as a "cover-up for one\'s sins, for which one has no remorse and... even less desire to be set free." In contrast, costly grace requires rigorously following Jesus in a way that leads to continuous, visible transformation, what the New Testament calls the fruits of redemption. The fruits of Kelly\'s redemption are now well-documented: reconciliation with her children, ministry to inmates full of despair, counsel to troubled youth and daily concern for others. On the night Kelly thought would be her last, she spent the evening writing a letter to her fellow inmates, urging them not to worry about her, but to be encouraged. Most poignant for Kelly are the writings of German theologian Jürgen Moltmann, who is widely known as the "theologian of hope" and with whom Kelly began corresponding in 2010. Moltmann shows that biblical hope is not a hope that gives up on this life and looks for something better beyond the grave. Rather, hope makes manifest the kingdom of God now --God\'s intended social order "on earth as it is in heaven" (Matt. 6:10). Biblical hope "revolutionizes and transforms the present."  It is the hope of the psalmist who "looks for the goodness of God in this life" (Ps. 27:13).  In the words of Kelly\'s favorite scripture, it is a hope that proclaims: "I shall not die but live, and declare the works of the Lord" (Ps 118:17). In Kelly\'s own words:. "The theology program has shown me that hope is still alive and that, despite a gate or a guillotine hovering over my head, I still possess the ability to prove that I am human. Labels on anyone can be notoriously misleading and unforgiving things. But no matter the label attached to me, I have the capacity and the unstoppable desire to accomplish something positive and have a lasting impact... Even prison cannot erase my hope or conviction that the future is not settled for me, or anyone." Many people have asked me in recent days how I have been transformed by my friendship with Kelly and by Kelly\'s journey of hope. While I struggle to find adequate words, what I do know is that Kelly\'s story pushes the logic of Christian faith to its outermost limits. It pushes Christians to reexamine and reaffirm the truths we proclaim about repentance, forgiveness, redemption and hope. Indeed, even professional theologians and life-long pastors struggle with the weight of the claims we make. Today, Kelly\'s life hangs in the balance. The state of Georgia on Monday issued a last-minute postponement of her execution, citing concerns about the drugs that were to be used to kill her. The Department of Corrections has said that it plans to resume executions once an analysis of the drugs is complete. While Gov. Nathan Deal does not have the formal power to commute Kelly\'s sentence to life in prison, I join more than 1,100 faith leaders from across the nation, including more than 500 from Georgia, who have signed a letter urging the governor to use his political influence to save Kelly\'s life and to speak out publicly against her execution. I call on all people of good will to reach out to Gov. Deal and to Georgia state legislators to demand a more just, merciful, and accountable system of justice -- for Kelly and for all. As theologian Richard Amesbury wrote, "If the life even of a convicted murderer can be turned around and so radically redirected, then none of us is without hope." We need to hear Kelly Gissendaner proclaim to us -- as much as we proclaim to her -- that the promises of God are real.\n\nSummary:', params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0,

Alex Pring, a 7-year-old who was born with a partially developed right arm, received a surprise visit from actor Robert Downey Jr., who showed up as his famed Avengers character Tony Stark. What's more, the actor also presented Alex with a very special gift - a bionic Iron Man arm. Robert Downey Jr. dressed up as Tony Stark to present a young boy with a bionic Iron man arm. The arm was created thanks to Microsoft One Note's Collective Project and Limbitless Solutions, a group that develops affordable 3D-printed limbs. Alex Pring, a 7-year-old who was born with a partially developed right arm, received the 3-D arm. 'Had the absolute privilege of presenting a brand spanking new 3D-printed bionic Iron Man arm to Alex, the most dapper 7-year-old I’ve ever met,' wrote the actor on\xa0Facebook. He also posted a video, in which he comments the young man's bow tie and inquires about his travels. He then pulled out two boxes, one with an arm for him and one with an arm for Alex. The arm was created thanks to \xa0Microsoft One Note's Collective Project and\xa0Limbitless Solutions, a group that develops affordable\xa03D-printed limbs. 'Had the absolute privilege of presenting a brand spanking new 3D-printed bionic Iron Man arm to Alex, the most dapper 7-year-old I’ve ever met,' wrote the actor. Downey Jr. is not the first member of the Avengers to make a young fan's dream come true either, with Chris Evans recently visiting\xa0Seattle Children's Hospital dressed as Captain America. This after he won a Super Bowl bet against Chris Pratt, who had previously traveled to Boston to visit the kids at Christopher's Haven dressed as his Guardians of the Galaxy character Star-Lord. And while the chances of an actual visit from Downey Jr. and Evansmay be slim, both men can be seen this summer reprising their Marvel roles in Avengers: Age of Ultron.\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=128, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=False, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: [128000, 9370, 5730, 553, 279, 2768, 3754, 4652, 304, 220, 4386, 11460, 13, 5321, 2612, 279, 12399, 1193, 11, 2085, 904, 1023, 1495, 382, 17064, 512, 4054, 3995, 8334, 2751, 279, 6140, 311, 8493, 264, 1633, 3361, 13658, 449, 264, 1972, 26928, 46244, 13, 8683, 2394, 287, 11, 264, 220, 22, 4771, 6418, 889, 574, 9405, 449, 264, 26310, 8040, 1314, 6916, 11, 4036, 264, 13051, 4034, 505, 12360, 8563, 6419, 1216, 16014, 2637, 889, 8710, 709, 439, 813, 61403, 44197, 3752, 19036, 47849, 13, 3639, 596, 810, 11, 279, 12360, 1101, 10666, 8683, 449, 264, 1633, 3361, 8352, 482, 264, 293, 21427, 16979, 2418, 6916, 13, 8563, 6419, 1216, 16014, 13, 26435, 709, 439, 19036, 47849, 311, 3118, 264, 3995, 8334, 449, 264, 293, 21427, 16979, 893, 6916, 13, 578, 6916, 574, 3549, 9523, 311, 5210, 3861, 7181, 596, 60018, 5907, 323, 13903, 4590, 1752, 23508, 11, 264, 1912, 430, 39671, 17049, 220, 18, 35, 43245, 291, 49695, 13, 8683, 2394, 287, 11, 264, 220, 22, 4771, 6418, 889, 574, 9405, 449, 264, 26310, 8040, 1314, 6916, 11, 4036, 279, 220, 18, 9607, 6916, 13, 364, 56568, 279, 10973, 26632, 315, 32644, 264, 6883, 76835, 502, 220, 18, 35, 43245, 291, 293, 21427, 16979, 2418, 6916, 311, 8683, 11, 279, 1455, 294, 3183, 220, 22, 4771, 6418, 358, 4070, 3596, 2322, 2965, 6267, 279, 12360, 389, 4194, 21124, 13, 1283, 1101, 8621, 264, 2835, 11, 304, 902, 568, 6170, 279, 3995, 893, 596, 15631, 18623, 323, 304, 18164, 922, 813, 35292, 13, 1283, 1243, 13541, 704, 1403, 15039, 11, 832, 449, 459, 6916, 369, 1461, 323, 832, 449, 459, 6916, 369, 8683, 13, 578, 6916, 574, 3549, 9523, 311, 220, 4194, 13068, 3861, 7181, 596, 60018, 5907, 323, 4194, 53038, 4590, 1752, 23508, 11, 264, 1912, 430, 39671, 17049, 4194, 18, 35, 43245, 291, 49695, 13, 364, 56568, 279, 10973, 26632, 315, 32644, 264, 6883, 76835, 502, 220, 18, 35, 43245, 291, 293, 21427, 16979, 2418, 6916, 311, 8683, 11, 279, 1455, 294, 3183, 220, 22, 4771, 6418, 358, 4070, 3596, 2322, 2965, 6267, 279, 12360, 13, 6419, 1216, 16014, 13, 374, 539, 279, 1176, 4562, 315, 279, 44197, 311, 1304, 264, 3995, 8571, 596, 8063, 2586, 837, 3060, 11, 449, 11517, 30563, 6051, 17136, 4194, 72772, 15394, 596, 15429, 26435, 439, 22022, 5270, 13, 1115, 1306, 568, 2834, 264, 7445, 20904, 1297, 2403, 11517, 75087, 11, 889, 1047, 8767, 31796, 311, 10406, 311, 4034, 279, 6980, 520, 26035, 596, 42714, 26435, 439, 813, 62831, 315, 279, 20238, 3752, 7834, 8288, 541, 13, 1628, 1418, 279, 17393, 315, 459, 5150, 4034, 505, 6419, 1216, 16014, 13, 323, 30563, 18864, 387, 30453, 11, 2225, 3026, 649, 387, 3970, 420, 7474, 31736, 3876, 872, 22883, 13073, 304, 44197, 25, 13381, 315, 16991, 35785, 382, 19791, 25], prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

The 20-year-old biomedical science student had not broken 54sec until May last year. But she has been running so well this year — coming into her first senior major championships as the fastest in Europe — that missing out on gold was a blow. ‘I realise it’s a massive achievement but I did come into it wanting to win it,’ she said, ‘I know how hard I’ve worked and I think maybe I should have just got to the bell first.’ Seren Bundy-Davies continued her remarkable rise by winning a 400metres bronze medal   in Prague. Bundy-Davies, who studies part-time at the University of Manchester, was controversially beaten by drugs cheat Nataliya Pyhyda, who has served a two-year ban for taking anabolic steroid stanozolol. There was good news for Jenny Meadows, whose luck may be finally turning, it seems. Meadows, 33, is through to Sunday's 800m final after Russian Anastasiya Bazdyreva was disqualified for running outside the track. Meadows finished fourth in her semi-final but has been suffering from a bad cold all week and is not hopeful of getting a medal in the final. ‘I think I just need to go to bed,’ she said. Gold medal winner Nataliya Pyhyda, silver medal winner Indira Terrero and bronze  winner Bundy-Davies. Bundy-Davies competes during women's 400 meters  during the European Athletics Indoor Championships. Lee Emanuel took silver in the 3,000m behind Ali Kaya, who some argued should not be competing at the championships. Emanuel ran a personal best of 7min 44.48sec and was a long way behind Kaya, who was born and lives in Kenya but was representing Turkey. Meanwhile British pair Richard Kilty and Chijindu Ujah teed up a mouthwatering clash in Sunday's 60m final. Both sprinters each won their heat in identical times of 6.57sec.\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=128, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=False, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: [128000, 9370, 5730, 553, 279, 2768, 3754, 4652, 304, 220, 4386, 11460, 13, 5321, 2612, 279, 12399, 1193, 11, 2085, 904, 1023, 1495, 382, 17064, 512, 50, 17848, 96921, 9607, 402, 552, 8738, 1077, 23649, 10205, 555, 11230, 264, 220, 3443, 4150, 417, 40907, 37712, 304, 220, 4103, 13, 1227, 5132, 520, 279, 7665, 64368, 48854, 304, 68389, 13, 578, 220, 508, 4771, 6418, 94612, 8198, 5575, 1047, 539, 11102, 220, 4370, 5132, 3156, 3297, 1566, 1060, 13, 2030, 1364, 706, 1027, 4401, 779, 1664, 420, 1060, 2001, 5108, 1139, 1077, 1176, 10195, 3682, 59284, 439, 279, 26731, 304, 4606, 2001, 430, 7554, 704, 389, 6761, 574, 264, 12523, 13, 3451, 40, 39256, 433, 753, 264, 11191, 26501, 719, 358, 1550, 2586, 1139, 433, 19762, 311, 3243, 433, 23189, 1364, 1071, 11, 3451, 40, 1440, 1268, 2653, 358, 4070, 6575, 323, 358, 1781, 7344, 358, 1288, 617, 1120, 2751, 311, 279, 29519, 1176, 14639, 8409, 268, 96921, 9607, 402, 552, 8738, 1077, 23649, 10205, 555, 11230, 264, 220, 3443, 4150, 417, 40907, 37712, 256, 304, 68389, 13, 96921, 9607, 402, 552, 11, 889, 7978, 961, 7394, 520, 279, 3907, 315, 19922, 11, 574, 20733, 398, 31394, 555, 11217, 41868, 42701, 80574, 5468, 8671, 3315, 11, 889, 706, 10434, 264, 1403, 4771, 9120, 369, 4737, 459, 57565, 77848, 357, 5770, 89, 337, 337, 13, 2684, 574, 1695, 3754, 369, 52179, 78142, 11, 6832, 15369, 1253, 387, 5616, 13353, 11, 433, 5084, 13, 78142, 11, 220, 1644, 11, 374, 1555, 311, 7418, 596, 220, 4728, 76, 1620, 1306, 8690, 94425, 10426, 7911, 92811, 10470, 265, 6723, 574, 94676, 369, 4401, 4994, 279, 3839, 13, 78142, 8220, 11999, 304, 1077, 18768, 55962, 719, 706, 1027, 16066, 505, 264, 3958, 9439, 682, 2046, 323, 374, 539, 38650, 315, 3794, 264, 37712, 304, 279, 1620, 13, 3451, 40, 1781, 358, 1120, 1205, 311, 733, 311, 4950, 23189, 1364, 1071, 13, 7573, 37712, 13946, 42701, 80574, 5468, 8671, 3315, 11, 15310, 37712, 13946, 2314, 9008, 18122, 2382, 323, 40907, 220, 13946, 96921, 9607, 402, 552, 13, 96921, 9607, 402, 552, 4634, 288, 2391, 3278, 596, 220, 3443, 20645, 220, 2391, 279, 7665, 70831, 64368, 48854, 13, 12336, 77760, 3952, 15310, 304, 279, 220, 18, 11, 931, 76, 4920, 14925, 735, 12874, 11, 889, 1063, 18784, 1288, 539, 387, 27260, 520, 279, 59284, 13, 77760, 10837, 264, 4443, 1888, 315, 220, 22, 1083, 220, 2096, 13, 2166, 5132, 323, 574, 264, 1317, 1648, 4920, 735, 12874, 11, 889, 574, 9405, 323, 6439, 304, 37766, 719, 574, 14393, 17442, 13, 26982, 8013, 6857, 12131, 735, 15404, 323, 921, 3251, 485, 84, 549, 98496, 1028, 291, 709, 264, 11013, 13284, 287, 41003, 304, 7418, 596, 220, 1399, 76, 1620, 13, 11995, 38949, 388, 1855, 2834, 872, 8798, 304, 20086, 3115, 315, 220, 21, 13, 3226, 5132, 382, 19791, 25], prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

Police discovered more than 500 illegal plants growing in 11 different rooms in the four-storey house in Leeds, West Yorkshire. Chien Nguyen, 32, was jailed for three years and Hieu Nguyen, 35, for three years and fours months after they pleaded guilty to growing cannabis. The Vietnamese nationals tried to deny responsibility for the offence after being arrested. Chien Nguyen, 32, pictured left, \xa0was jailed for three years and Hieu Nguyen, 35, pictured right, was jailed for three years and four months after they both admitted cultivating cannabis. They claimed they believed the plants were 'Western vegetables' and did not know they were breaking the law. Police forced entry to the property on October 19 last year, after being alerted by a strong smell of the class B drug coming from the property. Once inside, officers found Hieu hiding in the framework of a sofa and Chien was in the void above a fake ceiling. Prosecutor Louise Pryke said over 100 high-powered lights had been fitted at the property to help the plants grow. Analysis later revealed that the plants were capable of producing more than 16kgs of cannabis. The two men were in the UK illegally and entered the country via the Czech Republic. Timothy Jacobs, mitigating, said the pair had been paid by others to look after the plants and were unaware of the scale of the operation. Mr Jacobs said it was accepted that both men would be facing lengthy prison sentences and would be deported upon release from custody. Police discovered more than 500 cannabis factory in the four-storey property in Delphs Lane, Leeds. Pictured: Street View image of the road. Judge Geoffrey Marson, QC, described the cannabis discovery as a 'thoroughly professional enterprise.' 'It was designed to produce significant quantities of cannabis for commercial use to be put on the streets of this and other cities to enrich the lives of those involved at the expense of the misery of those who are addicted,' he said at Leeds Crown Court. 'I am entirely satisfied that this was a commercial enterprise motivated in each of your cases by financial advantage. 'You were clearly entrusted by others playing leading roles with these plants.'\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=128, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=False, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: [128000, 9370, 5730, 553, 279, 2768, 3754, 4652, 304, 220, 4386, 11460, 13, 5321, 2612, 279, 12399, 1193, 11, 2085, 904, 1023, 1495, 382, 17064, 512, 32, 46900, 1752, 49577, 6857, 10791, 4401, 264, 7083, 1041, 11, 931, 19437, 8961, 3309, 4379, 814, 3463, 814, 1051, 7982, 364, 31382, 24822, 2965, 264, 5590, 6755, 13, 10289, 11352, 810, 1109, 220, 2636, 12079, 11012, 7982, 304, 220, 806, 2204, 12295, 304, 279, 3116, 34352, 88, 3838, 304, 52629, 11, 4410, 51327, 13, 921, 3675, 64261, 11, 220, 843, 11, 574, 55606, 369, 2380, 1667, 323, 473, 26235, 64261, 11, 220, 1758, 11, 369, 2380, 1667, 323, 90720, 4038, 1306, 814, 40001, 16390, 311, 7982, 19437, 13, 578, 49577, 57011, 6818, 311, 23973, 12014, 369, 279, 35355, 1306, 1694, 12800, 13, 921, 3675, 64261, 11, 220, 843, 11, 42666, 2163, 11, 220, 4194, 16514, 55606, 369, 2380, 1667, 323, 473, 26235, 64261, 11, 220, 1758, 11, 42666, 1314, 11, 574, 55606, 369, 2380, 1667, 323, 3116, 4038, 1306, 814, 2225, 16584, 99139, 19437, 13, 2435, 11922, 814, 11846, 279, 11012, 1051, 364, 55924, 24822, 6, 323, 1550, 539, 1440, 814, 1051, 15061, 279, 2383, 13, 10289, 9770, 4441, 311, 279, 3424, 389, 6664, 220, 777, 1566, 1060, 11, 1306, 1694, 67769, 555, 264, 3831, 22843, 315, 279, 538, 426, 5623, 5108, 505, 279, 3424, 13, 9843, 4871, 11, 9808, 1766, 473, 26235, 26092, 304, 279, 12914, 315, 264, 32169, 323, 921, 3675, 574, 304, 279, 742, 3485, 264, 12700, 22959, 13, 88428, 56578, 74514, 441, 1071, 927, 220, 1041, 1579, 41503, 13001, 1047, 1027, 29441, 520, 279, 3424, 311, 1520, 279, 11012, 3139, 13, 18825, 3010, 10675, 430, 279, 11012, 1051, 13171, 315, 17843, 810, 1109, 220, 845, 74, 5981, 315, 19437, 13, 578, 1403, 3026, 1051, 304, 279, 6560, 38484, 323, 10862, 279, 3224, 4669, 279, 34250, 5545, 13, 45568, 52756, 11, 36090, 1113, 11, 1071, 279, 6857, 1047, 1027, 7318, 555, 3885, 311, 1427, 1306, 279, 11012, 323, 1051, 41747, 315, 279, 5569, 315, 279, 5784, 13, 4491, 52756, 1071, 433, 574, 11928, 430, 2225, 3026, 1053, 387, 13176, 35306, 9527, 23719, 323, 1053, 387, 68210, 5304, 4984, 505, 25502, 13, 10289, 11352, 810, 1109, 220, 2636, 19437, 8803, 304, 279, 3116, 34352, 88, 3424, 304, 7462, 764, 82, 27109, 11, 52629, 13, 393, 30375, 25, 6825, 2806, 2217, 315, 279, 5754, 13, 20819, 89239, 2947, 942, 11, 43707, 11, 7633, 279, 19437, 18841, 439, 264, 364, 339, 14776, 398, 6721, 20790, 3238, 364, 2181, 574, 6319, 311, 8356, 5199, 33776, 315, 19437, 369, 8518, 1005, 311, 387, 2231, 389, 279, 14708, 315, 420, 323, 1023, 9919, 311, 31518, 279, 6439, 315, 1884, 6532, 520, 279, 20900, 315, 279, 58701, 315, 1884, 889, 527, 57727, 2965, 568, 1071, 520, 52629, 29743, 7301, 13, 364, 40, 1097, 11622, 20097, 430, 420, 574, 264, 8518, 20790, 27762, 304, 1855, 315, 701, 5157, 555, 6020, 9610, 13, 364, 2675, 1051, 9539, 86382, 555, 3885, 5737, 6522, 13073, 449, 1521, 11012, 22438, 19791, 25], prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

An episode of 'Jeopardy!' has been deemed the most difficult to watch after only one contestant was left advancing to the final round.\xa0After contestants Stephanie Hull and Brad King were eliminated, Kristin Sausville (above) was standing alone in the Final Jeopardy round on Thursday night, a sight which left viewers shocked. Following the two cringe-worthy rounds of contestants repeatedly answering the questions wrong, it proved to be possibly one of the worst in history of 'Jeopardy!' (above Sausville and Jeopardy! host Alex Trebek) Previously, a contestant, who surprisingly competed against Sausville's husband in the Tournament of Champions, found themselves in a one-person round, according to\xa0People. At the end of the cringe-worthy second round, Hull and King did so terribly they were left with scores in the negatives - King with -200 and Hull with -$6,800, while Sausville had $8,400. Hull and King did so terribly they were left with scores in the negatives - King with -200 and Hull with -$6,800, while Sausville had $8,400 in that round (above their scores above at the end of the second round) This left her in the winning spot after Hull and King were eliminated, and host Alex Trebek could not help but admit 'this is not one of our greatest days' (above Sausville in the one-woman Final Jeopardy round with top U.S. government. She was asked: 'On August 15, 1994, 59 years and one day after FDR signed the Original Act, Bill Clinton made this an agency'.

Sausville, 34, a stay-at-home mom from Delaware, has played Jeopardy as a child and had guidance from her husband, Justin, who was a six-time champ and 2011 Tournament of Champions wild-card semifinalist, according to Delaware Online. And when the mother-of-two found herself alone on stage, she said she was really feeling her nerves. 'It was more nerve-racking to be the only person on stage,' said Sausville. 'On the one hand, it was nice not to have to worry about what anyone else was wagering, but at the same time, it meant that all of the contestant coordinators, compliance people and stage crew were standing around me.'

Trebek then asked her the question: 'On August 15, 1994, 59 years and one day after FDR signed the Original Act, Bill Clinton made this an agency'. He gave her 30 seconds to deliberate before saying, 'Kristen we're going to start with you,' which was met with laughs from both the audience and her, as the podiums next to her remained empty. Sausville went on to answer the question incorrectly with 'FDIC', and lost $1,600 (the correct answer was the Social Security Administration). In the end, her two-day total was\xa0$31,601.\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0,

Please output the summary only, without any other text.\n\nArticle:\nCarl Froch is challenging Andre Ward to cross the Atlantic for the first time in his career and face him at Nottingham Forest’s City Ground. Ward earned recognition as the world’s supreme super-middleweight when he defeated Froch in the final of the Super Six tournament in Atlantic City. But the American has fought only twice in the three years and three months since that points victory and the WBA are now ordering a mega rematch between him and Froch with both their belts on the line. Carl Froch wants a fight with Andre Ward to take place at the home of Nottingham Forest. Froch was last in the ring when he defeated George Groves at Wembley last summer. Ward is that organisation’s ‘super’ champion, Froch the holder of their ‘regular’ world title. The Nottingham Cobra is daring the man who calls himself Son Of God to nerve himself for a first fight outside the Americas. ‘I fought him in the US,’ Froch says. ‘Now it’s only right that he comes over here. To be a truly great champion you have to box overseas. ‘Ward needs to be forced to travel out of his comfort zone. ‘I dare him. He will discover that I’m a very different animal here than I was that night on the Boardwalk.’ Froch would love the fight with Ward to take place at the City Ground where his team Forest play. Froch clearly hasn't been slacking off since last summer as this picture posted on Twitter shows. Ward (left) signed with Jay Z's Roc Nation Sports promotional company earlier this year. That evening of December 17, 2011 represented Ward’s only fight in more than six years outside his native California, where the overwhelming majority of his bouts have taken place. The closest he has come to risking his unbeaten record abroad has been in two relatively insignificant fights in the Caribbean in 2007 and 2008. Froch suspects Ward believes he will relinquish the WBA belt, as he did his IBF world championship last month. But he warns: ‘I vacated the IBF title so as not to delay James DeGale from getting his chance any longer. But I’m not giving up the WBA title. No way.’ Froch is aware that without him bringing a belt to the table there would be little incentive for Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr to go ahead with a fight in Las Vegas, which is one of the Cobra’s two remaining ambitions. Froch lost to Ward on points back in December 2011 in Atlantic City, New Jersey. That defeat for the Cobra was one of only two in his career as a professional. The other is to box at the ground of his beloved Forest, which was the potential venue for a clash with America’s veteran idol Bernard Hopkins. Froch accepts that the WBA mandatory ruling means Ward must now take the place of Hopkins in those talks. The WBA are giving them until the end of this month to negotiate terms, before putting the fight out to purse bids. Froch expects that to happen, which might necessitate a change of dates. Promoter Eddie Hearn, with whom he meets this week to discuss strategy for the negotiations, is provisionally holding the City Ground for May 30. That is the night of the FA Cup final and there would be a sizeable over-carry of TV viewers from Wembley on to pay-per-view with Sky. But Froch says: ‘That is already short notice for me and if we have to wait for purse bids there won’t be time for proper training camps for either of us. I would hope we can find another date in middle to late June.’ He has been pondering retirement since his brutal KO of George Groves at Wembley. That remains an option, even though he has kept working in the gym to maintain an impressive physique, as a recent picture posted on Twitter reveals. Froch had been due to face Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr (left) but was forced out with an injury. Froch is also keen to fight ring legend Bernard Hopkins (left) who lost to Sergey Kovalev last year. ‘I will only get back in the ring for a fight that really floats my boat,’ says Froch. ‘And when you think about it, beating Ward in Nottingham would be a fantastic way to end my career.’ Highly regarded though Ward is, such a triumph is not beyond the realm of possibility. In fact, the timing would offer Froch his best chance of avenging one of the only two losses on his record – as well as inflicting a first defeat on Ward. Embroiled in promotional disputes and plagued by injuries, Ward has fought only once in two-and-a-half years. And that was a full year and four months ago in a points victory over Edwin Rodriguez, who had failed to make the weight and mostly went through the motions of a non-title bout. Froch says: ‘The nine months since I knocked out George is the longest I’ve been out but Ward has to be really rusty. ‘Also, a lot went wrong for me in that Super Six final. I was looking forward to appearing in Madison Square Garden but it was moved to Atlantic City.Out on the shore in the cold of mid-winter. Disappointing. The date was pushed back so I had to hang around in America a lot longer than planned. It ended up a week before Christmas and my mind was on getting home to the family instead of the fight. ‘It’ll be very different in the English summer.’ And what more pleasant time could there be to re-float the boat?\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[],

Please output the summary only, without any other text.\n\nArticle:\nShocking new images released today have shown ISIS terrorists toppling crosses, smashing Christian relics with hammers and erecting the black flag of ISIS on churches in Iraq. The latest photos show the militants vandalising churches in Nineveh, the ancient capital of the Assyrian empire. Pictured in civilian clothing, the ISIS thugs are seen overturning statues, destroying religious icons and replacing Christian crosses with the chilling ISIS banner. This chilling image shows an ISIS thug destroying a cross on a church and replacing it with the ISIS banner. Dressed in civilian clothing, a militant takes a claw hammer to a priceless relief at a Nineveh church. ISIS have killed Christians who have refused to convert to Islam and want to cleanse its caliphate of its Christian heritage. The disturbing images - provided by the Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI) - are the latest evidence of ISIS trying to cleanse its caliphate of its Christian heritage. ISIS claim ancient relics promote idolatry that violates their fundamentalist interpretation of Islamic law. MEMRI director Steven Stalinsky said: 'They don't care what it's called; they are just following their ideology and that means getting rid of churches and minorities. It is the Islamic State, and there's no room for anyone else. 'This has been going on for some time, a systematic campaign to rid the region of any vestiges of Christianity.' In February, the terrorist organisation decapitated 21 Egyptian Coptic Christians on the shores of Libya and then kidnapped more than 220 Assyrian Christians when militants swept into about 12 villages. Thousands of other Iraqi Christians have fled their homes in fear and are having to find temporary accommodation in the surrounding region. Archbishop Silvano Tomasi, the Vatican's top diplomat at the UN in Geneva, said yesterday the jihadists were committing 'genocide' and must be stopped. The Vatican traditionally opposes military intervention in the region. ISIS claim ancient relics promote idolatry that violates their fundamentalist interpretation of Islamic law. Two ISIS militants overturn a cross on a Christian site in Nineveh in the organisation's latest shocking act. ISIS currently controls a swath of land slightly larger than the UK, from Aleppo to central Iraq. The fanatics have caused outrage by destroying several ancient relics and sites in Iraq recently, as well as books and rare manuscripts. Earlier this month, ISIS went on a rampage in the Assyrian city of Nimrud in northern Iraq, destroying the 3,000 year-old winged statues placed at the gates of the Palace of Ashurnasirpal. They also bulldozed 2,000-year-old Hatra - another UNESCO World Heritage site. In recent weeks, ISIS have also set off bombs around Mosul Central Library, destroying as many as 10,000 priceless and irreplaceable books and manuscripts. Nineveh, in northern Iraq, was once the largest city in the world with a population of as many as 150,000 people in 700BC - it lies close to Mosul, the largest city under ISIS control.\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0, frequency_penalty=0.0, repetition_penalty=1.0, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, top_k=0, min_p=0.0, seed=None, stop=[], stop_token_ids=[], bad_words=[], include_stop_str_in_output=False, ignore_eos=False, max_tokens=128, min_tokens=0, logprobs=None, prompt_logprobs=None, skip_special_tokens=False, spaces_between_special_tokens=True, truncate_prompt_tokens=None, guided_decoding=None, extra_args=None), prompt_token_ids: [128000, 9370, 5730, 553, 279, 2768, 3754, 4652, 304, 220, 4386, 11460, 13, 5321, 2612, 279, 12399, 1193, 11, 2085, 904, 1023, 1495, 382, 17064, 512, 2059, 71191, 502, 5448, 6004, 3432, 617, 6982, 23474, 29331, 1948, 12127, 50535, 11, 83588, 9052, 99516, 449, 305, 43157, 323, 38732, 287, 279, 3776, 5292, 315, 23474, 389, 31012, 304, 11340, 13, 578, 5652, 7397, 1501, 279, 39449, 62507, 3876, 31012, 304, 38166, 15555, 11, 279, 14154, 6864, 315, 279, 98113, 7414, 32447, 13, 393, 30375, 304, 30028, 17895, 11, 279, 23474, 86419, 527, 3970, 67687, 287, 59002, 11, 33812, 10597, 24699, 323, 25935, 9052, 50535, 449, 279, 62724, 23474, 24206, 13, 1115, 62724, 2217, 5039, 459, 23474, 270, 773, 33812, 264, 5425, 389, 264, 8993, 323, 25935, 433, 449, 279, 23474, 24206, 13, 423, 14715, 304, 30028, 17895, 11, 264, 52382, 5097, 264, 57590, 24354, 311, 264, 92044, 16337, 520, 264, 38166, 15555, 8993, 13, 23474, 617, 7577, 22125, 889, 617, 16436, 311, 5625, 311, 15256, 323, 1390, 311, 81155, 1202, 1652, 15619, 349, 315, 1202, 9052, 28948, 13, 578, 34973, 5448, 482, 3984, 555, 279, 12877, 6460, 7972, 8483, 10181, 320, 33070, 4403, 8, 482, 527, 279, 5652, 6029, 315, 23474, 4560, 311, 81155, 1202, 1652, 15619, 349, 315, 1202, 9052, 28948, 13, 23474, 3802, 14154, 99516, 12192, 49014, 266, 894, 430, 51413, 872, 16188, 380, 23692, 315, 15558, 2383, 13, 25486, 4403, 7690, 24565, 800, 278, 52541, 1071, 25, 364, 7009, 1541, 956, 2512, 1148, 433, 596, 2663, 26, 814, 527, 1120, 2768, 872, 34649, 323, 430, 3445, 3794, 9463, 315, 31012, 323, 40804, 13, 1102, 374, 279, 15558, 3314, 11, 323, 1070, 596, 912, 3130, 369, 5606, 775, 13, 364, 2028, 706, 1027, 2133, 389, 369, 1063, 892, 11, 264, 37538, 4901, 311, 9463, 279, 5654, 315, 904, 28705, 52763, 315, 32186, 3238, 763, 7552, 11, 279, 20320, 22139, 1654, 391, 33337, 220, 1691, 33589, 356, 94783, 22125, 389, 279, 63263, 315, 38059, 323, 1243, 55945, 810, 1109, 220, 8610, 98113, 7414, 22125, 994, 39449, 41323, 1139, 922, 220, 717, 33889, 13, 63294, 315, 1023, 31334, 22125, 617, 30010, 872, 10632, 304, 8850, 323, 527, 3515, 311, 1505, 13643, 28377, 304, 279, 14932, 5654, 13, 82311, 8211, 85, 5770, 8529, 10426, 11, 279, 47647, 596, 1948, 69050, 520, 279, 6781, 304, 45345, 11, 1071, 13985, 279, 94380, 1051, 40583, 364, 4469, 43277, 6, 323, 2011, 387, 10717, 13, 578, 47647, 36342, 76312, 6411, 21623, 304, 279, 5654, 13, 23474, 3802, 14154, 99516, 12192, 49014, 266, 894, 430, 51413, 872, 16188, 380, 23692, 315, 15558, 2383, 13, 9220, 23474, 39449, 67687, 264, 5425, 389, 264, 9052, 2816, 304, 38166, 15555, 304, 279, 22139, 596, 5652, 34734, 1180, 13, 23474, 5131, 11835, 264, 93512, 315, 4363, 10284, 8294, 1109, 279, 6560, 11, 505, 58221, 311, 8792, 11340, 13, 578, 8571, 29470, 617, 9057, 30229, 555, 33812, 3892, 14154, 99516, 323, 6732, 304, 11340, 6051, 11, 439, 1664, 439, 6603, 323, 9024, 79688, 13, 47993, 420, 2305, 11, 23474, 4024, 389, 264, 94163, 304, 279, 98113, 7414, 3363, 315, 47683, 67455, 304, 18671, 11340, 11, 33812, 279, 220, 18, 11, 931, 1060, 6418, 20611, 291, 59002, 9277, 520, 279, 35634, 315, 279, 31396, 315, 14937, 399, 300, 404, 19866, 13, 2435, 1101, 79942, 9700, 291, 220, 17, 11, 931, 4771, 6418, 22050, 969, 482, 2500, 81876, 4435, 34243, 2816, 13, 763, 3293, 5672, 11, 23474, 617, 1101, 743, 1022, 33606, 2212, 62913, 10913, 11896, 11, 33812, 439, 1690, 439, 220, 605, 11, 931, 92044, 323, 6348, 8319, 481, 6603, 323, 79688, 13, 38166, 15555, 11, 304, 18671, 11340, 11, 574, 3131, 279, 7928, 3363, 304, 279, 1917, 449, 264, 7187, 315, 439, 1690, 439, 220, 3965, 11, 931, 1274, 304, 220, 7007, 5002, 482, 433, 15812, 3345, 311, 62913, 11, 279, 7928, 3363, 1234, 23474, 2585, 382, 19791, 25], prompt_embeds shape: None, lora_request: None, prompt_adapter_request: None.

Obama's executive order also directs the government to ramp up use of renewable energy sources to 30 percent of the federal government's consumption. The White House said U.S. taxpayers could save up to $18 billion in electricity costs by reducing greenhouse gases 40 percent over the next decade, compared to 2008 levels. 'These are ambitious goals, but we know they're achievable goals,' Obama said at the Energy Department on Thursday, where he toured a rooftop solar panel installation after signing the executive order at the White House. 'These are ambitious goals, but we know they're achievable goals,' President Barack Obama said at the Energy Department on Thursday after signing the executive order at the White House. The White House said U.S. taxpayers could save up to $18 billion in electricity costs by reducing greenhouse gases 40 percent over the next decade, compared to 2008 levels. Obama is pictured her giving the order. Major companies that sell to the federal government like GE, HP, Northrup Grumman and Honeywell will also announce voluntary commitments to cut their own emissions of the heat-trapping gases blamed for global warming, the White House said. IBM, for example, said it will cut its energy consumption 35 percent by 2020 and buy at least 20 percent of its power from renewably sources by that year. The operator of an estimated 360,000 buildings and 650,000 vehicles, the federal government is the country's single largest energy consumer. The Department of Defense alone is responsible for roughly half of that consumption, a senior administration official said. All told, the government pollution cuts along with industry contributions will have the effect of keeping 26 million metric tons of greenhouse gases out of the air by 2025, or the equivalent of what about 5.5 million cars would pump out through their tailpipes in an average year, the White House said. Brian Deese, a senior adviser to Obama, told reporters that the president's mandate is a 'triple win' for the environment, the economy, and the taxpayer. Yet it was unclear exactly how either the government or private companies planned to meet its targets. 'The potential from this announcement,' Deese said during a call with reporters, 'is significant both because we can drive substantial reductions across the entire federal footprint and because our efforts to do that leverage both innovation and investment in the private sector.' While at the Energy Department, Obama also discussed the new emissions targets at a roundtable with federal suppliers that do more than $1 billion per year in business with the government. The U.S. government is responsible for only a small portion of the world's greenhouse gas emissions, but the Obama administration is hoping that taking aggressive steps at home will increase the political pressure on other countries to do the same. 'Certainly our hope is that we are laying forth template that other countries could also learn from and look at as well,' Deese noted. President Barack Obama tours solar panels on the roof of the Energy Department on Thursday with Eric Haukdal, Energy Department Energy Manager, left, Deputy Energy Secretary Liz Sherwood-Randall, second from the right, and Kate Brandt, Federal Chief Sustainability Officer, right. Climate change was reportedly a topic \xa0of discussion at the president's Oval Office meeting on Thursday afternoon with Prince Charles, who is next in line for the throne in Britain, and the Duchess of Cornwall Camilla. A major global climate treaty, in the works for years, is supposed to be finalized in December at a summit in Paris, but most countries have yet to announce what their national contributions to the pact will be. Earlier this month the European Union unveiled its contribution, vowing to cut greenhouse gas emissions at least 40 percent by 2030, compared to 1990. The U.S. has yet to announce its contribution to the treaty. But in a bid to build momentum last year, Obama set a U.S. goal to cut emissions up to 28 percent by 2025 — compared to 2005 levels — in a joint announcement with China that boosted hopes that an aggressive climate treaty may come to fruition. The president hasn't fully explained how he'll meet that goal, but his aides have suggested that unprecedented pollution limits he's imposing on power plants will get the U.S. much of the way there. Obama's executive order directs the federal government to cut energy use in federal buildings 2.5 percent every year between 2015 and 2025 and reduce the amount of water used in federal buildings 2 percent every year through 2025. It also advises federal agencies to decrease greenhouse gas emissions from government-owned vehicles by 30 percent per mile by 2025, compared to the levels in 2014, and put more hybrid and zero-emission vehicles in their fleets. Additionally, it seeks to ensure federal agencies are getting 25 percent of their energy — both heat and electricity — from clean sources by 2025.\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1,

Please output the summary only, without any other text.\n\nArticle:\nThere are a million women who wouldn't mind swapping places with Sarah Greene. Unlike the rest of the nation's females, Aidan Turner's beautiful Irish girlfriend is lucky enough to enjoy the smouldering Poldark star for real. The 29-year-old actress may not yet be a household name but she's also a long way off being just Turner's squeeze with a blossoming acting career of her own. They are very much a couple whose stars are in the ascendant. Scroll down for video. A very aspiring couple: Poldark star Aidan Turner, 31, with his girlfriend, 29-year-old actress Sarah Greene. Behind every brooding man: The couple have been together for four years and have weathered working apart for their careers. They say Skype has helped... And he is clearly smitten with his girlfriend of four years. In an interview with the\xa0Sunday Times\xa0this weekend, the 31-year-old Irishman says that while many couples, particularly those in the limelight, might have seen their relationship foundering under the pressure of work commitments, they didn't have that problem. 'You meet someone, you fall in love, then you can only see them over Skype or phone calls or texts and emails. And you have this whole other side to your relationship and it's... it was fun. He continues: 'We knew we really wanted to be together. And knew if we could do that, we could tackle a lot more. It was never: God, this is hard, bloody hell, we need to review this. This sucks. We never questioned it; it was great. So we had that from the beginning...' Early on in the couple's relationship, Greene painted a similar picture, previously admitting to the Irish Times that they are both resigned to periods apart: 'Well, that's the job we do. We'll always travel with work. Skype is great, and we're getting on brilliantly. 'It's been actually quite easy because we're both working. If I wasn't working it would be a lot harder.' Irish eyes: Greene, who was born in Cork, starred opposite Daniel Radcliffe in The Cripple of Innishmaan and was nominated for both a Laurence Olivier award and a Tony Award for her performance. So, who exactly is Sarah Greene and how did she successfully woo the man that is currently capturing millions of hearts while playing Cornish legend Captain Ross Poldark in the hit BBC series? To date, the Cork-born actress is best known for playing opposite Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe in The Cripple of Inishmaan. Greene played the role of Helen McCormick in the play and trod the boards in the London production in 2013 before transferring to Broadway the following year.\xa0It was a role that garnered plenty of praise from critics; nominations for Laurance Olivier and Tony Awards followed. The actress is currently starring in Penny Dreadful, a Dublin-based Sky Atlantic horror show about the cheap-to-buy, sensationalist books of the same name which were published in the 19th century. Masterpiece! Turner has admitted to using baby oil to make his body look perfect on screen. Although the Poldark star has said he had to seriously hit the gym to perfectly hone his physique, the make-up department had another trick to ensure his body looked suitably granite-like for the hit BBC show. Turner says that some kind of 'baby oil' was used to make his muscles ripple perfectly for the camera. And Captain Poldark's striking eyes might suggest Turners' own peepers were enhanced with make-up but that's not the case. He told the Times that while he had to wear eyeliner for'some scenes', he definitely doesn't lush up his lashes with mascara. A role in the Canadian-Irish television series Vikings also raised the Irish beauty's profile and it seems Hollywood now beckons too.\xa0Later this year, the striking brunette is set to start work on a comedy, playing opposite Bradley Cooper and Sienna Miller. Born in Cork, Greene trained in Dublin, graduating from the Gaiety School of Acting in 2006 after becoming obsessed with being an actress after going to watch a local panto. She said: 'My parents took myself and my sister to see the Christmas panto Red Riding Hood in the Cork Opera House and I was sold, all I wanted to do was get up on the stage!' The couple met after working together in the play Titus Andronicus but it was a slow burn before a relationship developed. He told Irish Weekend Magazine in 2013: 'I did a play with her about eight years ago Titus Andronicus, directed by Selina Cartmell. 'I played Demetrius, her character wasn't a named character but we met on that. 'It was all very platonic and we never hooked up or anything, but that's how we got to know each other. And then years later we just met again and it just sort of took off.' His brooding good looks aren't always so refined either.\xa0The actor has confessed that he is 'inherently lazy' and only really got in shape for Poldark as filming start dates approached. 'I worked hard for six weeks, killing myself in the gym, watching what I eat and staying away from bad food. But I would never, ever do all that if I wasn't prepping for a role. That's the only time it just happens,' he explained. 'I'm not like that now. I'm back to my usual soft self.' It hasn't always been plain sailing on the love front either. Speaking to the Daily Mirror about being hurt by a past girlfriend, the actor said: 'Yes, it's happened to me. I've been upset, my heart's been broken. 'I don't know anyone on the planet who hasn't had their heart broken. Love is love. 'It's the purest and rawest thing we have in life and everyone experiences it.' He may have found happiness with Greene, but talks of engagement are too hasty. Last week, she told Irish entertainment websites and Goss.ie and Evoke.ie while at an event in Dublin: 'I'm not engaged.'\n\nSummary:", params: SamplingParams(n=1, presence_penalty=0.0,
