Van der Garde, who was axed as test driver by Sauber at the end of last season, claims he was promised a full-time race seat for the forthcoming campaign that begins in Australia this weekend.

Chelsea have scored in each of their last 18 Champions League home games. The last time they failed to find the net at Stamford Bridge was in April 2011 against Manchester Utd.

text_response:   Lewis Hamilton began the new Formula One season in stunning fashion with a crushing qualifying performance to grab the fourth pole position of his career for the Australian Grand Prix. It is clear that after a dominant 2014 from Mercedes they will again be the team to beat in 2015 as reigning champion Hamilton blasted his way to top spot on the grid at Melbourne's Albert Park, putting even team-mate Nico Rosberg in the shade. Hamilton finished with a lap of one minute 26.327secs, a staggering 0.6secs clear of Rosberg as Mercedes locked out the front row, with Williams' Felipe Massa the best of
text_response:   Tottenham striker Harry Kane has contributed 22 points in the Premier League this season, while team-mate Christian Eriksen is runner-up on 13. Kane is poised to make his senior England debut this week after receiving his first call-up and with good reason as Sportsmail reveal the top 20 players that have contributed for their clubs so far. Yet Tottenham aren't alone in relying on a player or two. Queens Park Rangers would be bottom without Charlie Austin, and Burnley would be, too, if Danny Ings was taken out of the picture. Harry Kane runs away in celebration after scoring against Leicester City as he went on his

Men are now more likely to live a longer proportion of their lives in good health than women. However, women still live longer than men overall – though the gap is closing. The statistics, released yesterday, showed that over the past three years the expectancy of life in good health for a baby girl in England has dropped by nearly four months.

He appears in the list of 12 disciples called by Jesus, but does not become a main character in the drama until the Passion Narratives. His story ends with his dramatic suicide, and Luke tells us that his stomach burst open and his intestines gushed out when he died. The Gospel writers themselves single out Judas as the one who would betray Jesus, but they, of course, are writing with the benefit of hindsight. We can only guess as to what was in the mind of the historical Jesus. Our lack of knowledge about this and many other aspects in the life of

This is according to a new study that has combined 18-years worth of ice shelf thinning data from three different sets of satellites. The researchers claim that some ice shelves in West Antarctica have lost as much as 18 per cent of their volume in the last ten years. Scroll down for video. Rates of thickness change (metres/decade) are colour-coded from -25 (thinning) to +10 (thickening). Circles represent percentage of thickness lost (red) or gained (blue)
